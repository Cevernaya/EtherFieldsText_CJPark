*We see nothing but omnipresent mist...*

If you're reading this script, it means that something has gone wrong. No path leads to this script - maybe you started reading the Secret Scripts book from the beginning, which is against the rules.

During the game, you will be pointed to read certain scripts - search for the script's number, then read it and resolve all its effects.

*"You have to know that far east from the shore, beyond a rather huge wave, there is an ancient, forlorn
observatory. But you won't get there unless you circle around it."*

- Gain **1** `gem`


# 3
***Ship's log 02.*** 

*I start the ignition. Fuel injection overloads the engines; exploding to life and drowning me in a deafening roar. The hull convulses, threatening to rip apart. The computers go crazy but we're too high up to do anything but pray. Cities turn into dots, receding away rapidly until they are nothing but glowing dots in the dark. Eventually I can see the shapes of the continents and oceans. Majestic Mother Earth. And then everything begins to sink into the cosmic darkness dotted with stars.*

*Finally, there is silence...*

*Thousands of small blinking lights start streaking down into the Earth's atmosphere. Millions of meteors smashing into the ground and other strange shapes that I can barely make out. I zoom in on the fiery hell. There are smoke trails and burning fires for miles all over the surface. My throat closes up and I have trouble breathing.* 

*Communication is broken. What's happening?*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`

- Cross out the number on the **"Reading the Ship's log"** and write a new one: **"476"**.

*"Do it! Don't you have the courage? I thought not! Look, I did it once! That's why I'm here. You don't have the guts for it..."*

*Enough. Enough of this screeching, I can't take it anymore. Disappear forever!*

*The black creature falls down, cursing and laughing at the same time. Soon, it's quiet.*

*However all those unpleasant words echo in our minds.*

*This nightmare continues. We did not succeed, unfortunately.*

*How many more times will we climb this tower?*

[Resolve] -> (176).


# 5
*Here we are. We need to stretch the old pins a bit after the journey.*

*We see giant creatures floating in the air - they resemble whales, but they must be as light as balloons. Perhaps the smallest thorn could be fatal to them.*

*The clouds part for a moment and a giant eye peers through the swirling gates. Apparently it notices nothing interesting because, after a while, the crack in the clouds closes. It's quiet again, calm, almost boring.*

<u>***Victory.***</u> Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`. Each Dreamer cures **1** `damage` or **Unseals 1 card**.

- Restore **3 Shopping cards (II-41 C)**.

- Change the Season to **Season of Regeneration**.

- Discard the current Dreamscape. Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already
gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets.

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream - you can still come back here to try again.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 6
*Really? Nothing? Nothing at all?*

*We pass the beast, still gliding into the ever-increasing emptiness of outer space. From here on out, we are alone and there is nothing in front of us.*

<u>*Failure.*</u> 

- Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets.

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream - you can still come back here to try again.

- Change the Season to **Season of Plague**.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 7
*The sun is already setting, the district is slowly falling silent and fog covers the streets. We see a lonely figure - very far away, between the buildings. We think she's calling us over.*

You may Spawn **1 Fearspecter** (unless there are already 4) and add **3 Morphings** to add **card D** to the **Fate deck**.

# 8
*We stare into the rift filled with silvery swirling shadows. Those are our lost memories, flashbacks from the past hours, maybe days, even years. These are messy scraps of our lives. Amongst these scraps we can see something important - a fleeting memory - something bad happened to the world. We remember a laboratory and...*

*It's hard to break through that wall of forgetfulness.*

- Pay **1** `gem` to gain **1** `ether`*. An effect like this only applies to the Dreamer who activated this action whereas if a script informs you that "**All** Dreamers or **Each** Dreamer..." then it would apply to everybody. In this case the Dreamer who activated this action must alone choose to pay **1**`gem` in order to gain `ether`.

Also remember that you can *discard 3 influence cards* from your hand at this time in order to obtain a `gem` to pay for this.

*What is `ether` exactly?* `ether` or "**ether**" represent experience gained by the Dreamers. They can be used to purchase Influence cards to improve Dreamers' decks or pay for certain other effects. `ether` is ***always*** valuable. 

If the Trap card is revealed, discard it back to the **Secrets of this Dream**.

*Please note that this is an addition by the creators of this app and is a ***deviation away from the Book of Scripts***. We felt like rewarding you for such tough work (especially if playing with multiple people) with more than flavour text and teaching you about gaining and paying for things.This is the only time we make such drastic a change, we promise! For the purists among you, simply ignore the non-flavour text portion of this script entirely. :)

# 9
*Something entirely different must hide behind the blue door. But you probably suspect that this wasn't about guessing or telling stories, right?*

=>Change the Season to the **one of your choice**.

=>Each Dreamer gains **2** `ether`.


# 10
*"What a risky play. Giving us a part of yourself? We won't take it this time but be careful with what you have. However we won't refuse a small chunk of your flesh if you insist..."*

*Nothing happens* - take this token back.

=>You may **Seal 1 card**/**suffer 1** `damage` to move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.


# 11
*No one is just a mindless beast, nothing is ever black and white. No one is born a devil but it's very easy to become one along the way. There is hardly any way back for this creature. As soon as the creature crawls onto the top of a crate, it drifts away into the darkness. Maybe it won't come back to this place anymore. But it does have to feed - it'll probably find a new place, a new district, where it'll take root and, in time, destroy the life around it, whether it wants to or not.*

*It is difficult to say whether or not we feel better about helping it. If everything was so simple, there would be no evil in the world. Everyone wants to be good in their own eyes believing they're right and others wrong.*

[Resolve] -> (309)

# 12
*Home again...*

*There's rubbish lying around but we've been away for such a long time. We open the window and look out onto an unkempt garden - we'll really have to clean it up a bit. An unread book is lying on the table. The bed is still unmade and the blanket is a little dusty. All of it doesn't matter. Because it's our true, forgotten home.*

*We used to live here a long time ago when we were still like children, when the world was still young. For a moment we're back to those happier days, before everything changed.*

*What really is our existence? I can't tell you anything you don't already know - I can only try to remind you of what you already knew deep down but forgot.*

Now, [resolve] -> (100).


# 13
*We hear screams from the tower's roof. Are they directed at us?*

*"Never... You'll never get anywhere! You are nobody! You are a punishment that I must endure!"*

*Grim accusations and insults stream down like an unstoppable river.*

=>Reveal **card A** (Water!) unless it's already revealed.

=>Discard **1** `gem` or gain **1** `threat` and add it to your `damage` pool - in this Dream treat `threat` in the same way as `damage`.

=>Gain **1** `gem` or **1 Story token**.


# 14
*We escape through the water. For a long time, we can't forget about this unusual place and find it difficult to adjust to the rest of the world - it's dull, peaceful and uninteresting. People we pass by don't have a clue about the life bustling under their feet - a foretaste of hell.*

*Then, one day, we wake up and wonder what has happened to us. We find filth disgusting again. We pick up all the empty food cartons that have accumulated in the last few days and drop them in the bin. The silver trashcan closes with a crash.*

<u>*Victory.*</u> Each Dreamer cures **1** `damage` or **Unseals 2 cards**.

- Discard **all Story tokens** gained in this Dream.

- Gain **card J (The 3rd Silver Key)**.

- Gain **1** `ether` for each completely full Effort Container (1,2, or 3) and share them between Dreamers as you wish.

- Restore **3 Shopping cards (II-41 C)**.

- Discard the current Dreamscape. Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets.

- Remove the Dream Gate tile of this Dream from the game, then gain **tile II-40 L ("Return to the Filthy District" Dream Gate tile)**.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 15
*A huge cloud of black birds swirls omninously above the roof. From afar they look like an angry ancient demon. Every sound is drowned out by the hum of a thousand voices - everything except a tired, feeble voice coming from inside.*

*"I sacrificed everything for you... Don't you remember? You have always been ungrateful and useless. And now you don't even want to help me when I need you this one time..."*

=> Discard the **Water! card** to the Secrets of this Dream.


# 16
You're looking at an **Overlay card** - it acts as a missing, additional, or a changed piece of the Dreamscape. You have to place this card on the Dreamscape immediately. How? Look closely and match it with **the grid and the code** (it's written on the Overlay card and the Dreamscape, e.g., Al, B2, etc.). Remember to match it precisely, even if this means placing it "askew," at a strange angle.

- Place all miniatures and tokens, which would be otherwise covered by the Overlay card, on top of it.

Done, right? Does it fit? The card may look strange at first, but it really has to be placed at this angle.

What has changed?

The door isn't open or closed anymore - it is *destroyed*! If there was a `block` token on it, discard it. One of the actions disappeared, and there's a new one.

There is also a fragment of a **Blocked space** - the one marked with a **red frame**. **No one and nothing can enter this space**.

![Blocked space](/assets/images/secrets/blocked-space.png "Blocked space")

- *And, through the passage on the game box cover, light pours...*


# 17
*Someone stands on the roof and screams. Who are they shouting at?*

*"Why can nothing be good, but everything has to be wrong? Is it my fault? Things won't get better in this world! You'll see for yourself, get used to it!"*

*A stream of regret mixed with anger flows endlessly.*

- Reveal **card A (Water!)** unless it's already revealed.

- Discard **1** `gem` or gain **1** `threat` and add it to your `damage` pool - in this Dream treat `threat` in the same way as `damage`.

- Gain **1** `gem` or **1 Story token**.


# 18
*An old lamp stands on the desk like an old soldier guarding the perimeter. We imagine how this place looked in the past:*

*The interior is clean and well-lit, large tomes heap up on the desk. A man as sad as the lamp bends over a book - "Not enough for rent, not enough for new commodities," he murmurs. "Too much competition. Everybody wants things that are hot and trendy which I don't have. Instead of buying things that are valuable and long-lasting, they prefer what is transient and unnecessary. We probably won't survive the next month." He was right.*

*The vision vanishes, and we are again in the dusty darkness.*

- Gain **card H (You can always find something in the darkness Wisdom card)**.

*Something cackles in the dark.* - If this is a `night` space, place **1** `threat` in this space (max. 1 `threat` per space).


# 19
*I pick an apple every day from "our" tree and there are always more!*

*An apple is juicy and tasty, and you know what they say about keeping the doctor away. Well, let's take one more for the road! :)*

- Add **1 Turn**.


# 20
*It's getting darker - there is less light coming through the cobwebs. I think it's the evening. The situation isn't getting any better, we're losing strength...*

- **Seal 4 cards** and [resolve] -> (965).


# 21
*All the necessary things hide in here: a spare cable, an old chair not yet thrown away, unwanted souvenirs that could no longer fit in the drawers. We need more and more space for these things. Maybe a bigger house? Extra batteries, less interesting books, a spare ladder, and so on - they will definitely come in handy someday, right? Maybe not now, but they will for sure. I guess.*

If this is a `light` space - gain **3** `gem` or **Restore 1 Item**. Then, place a `block` token on this action.

If this is a `night` space - add **1 Morphing** and roll the **Luck die**:

- `luck-x` = Suffer **1** `damage`.
- `luck-blank` = **Seal 2 cards**.

Finally, you may **Move the Locker 2 spaces** or **Relocate the Lamp** to any tile.

# 22
*We don't mind the raging waves, we glide on them and have a lot of fun. We would stay here longer but a lightning bolt strikes the water next to us making us jump about a mile out of our skins.*

=>Spend **1** `gem` or **suffer 1** `damage`.


# 23
*We agreed.*

*Chains fall to the ground and crawl away like scared snakes. The great beast stands tall and smiles at us - we fear that we made a mistake, but she keeps her word - not only does she give us the prize and the Key, but there's also the most wonderful dream waiting for us.*

*When we wake up, we are back in the forests of Phantasmagoria and not a single trace of the destroyed nightmare world remains. It has
not happened yet. Not yet! It was just a foray into the distant future. Fortunately, we don't have to worry about that today, right?*

<u>Neither Victory nor Failure.</u>

- Gain **1 Blank token** and write **"Pact"** on it.

- Gain **card E (The 6th Silver Key)**.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.

# 24
*The pack is ready to leave, but is it good enough? Let's find out.*

Add the value of the leaving pack of Intent markers (`green-marker` has a value of 3, `yellow-marker` of 5, and `red-marker` of 7). Then, discard them back to the pool and resolve the script corresponding to the calculated result:

- [3] -> (866),
- [5] -> (265),
- [6] -> (984),
- [7] -> (265),
- [8] -> (984),
- [9] -> (119),
- [10-13] -> (439),
- [14] -> (984),
- [15] -> (212),
- [17-19] -> (439),
- [21] -> (638),

Remember that the pack may have a **maximum of 3 Intent markers**. Overcomplicated Dreams are unwelcome in this Factory.


# 25
*"What's this? You want to give me some unnecessary rubbish? I won't touch it for anything in the world!"*

- Return it to the **Storage.**


# 26
*"I'm a bit full, but whatever, I'll still fit it in somehow."*

- You may return this model to the box and its card to the Influence/Item Market (if it was placed by Influence/Item cards) or remove its cards from the game (if it was placed by other cards). If you do this, each Dreamer **Reminds** three times, then move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

- If you change your mind now, **suffer 1** `damage` or **Seal 1 card**.


# 28
*We would all like to live forever, but all these dreams are so soft and fragile. We will meet them many more times because it is all just an endless dance of ghosts and thoughts.*

*Everything dissolves into the fog. Only the mother's silver tear remains on the floor.*

<u>*Victory.*</u> Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.

- Gain **card J (The 4th Silver Key)**.

- Each Dreamer may suffer **1** `damage` to **Unseal 3 cards**.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 29
*We pick some flowers - they are so beautiful and shiny that we will win the heart of our betrothed with their help. But the flowers wither and die immediately. We try again, but their beauty and life fade away yet again. They've lost their life and we're left with only temporal trinkets.*

- Gain **2**`gem`.


# 30
*We pull the lever.*

*A crash can be heard from the outside.*

Reveal **card C - a Trap** (if you have done it before and the Trap is already revealed - read the section below from **"If the Trap card is revealed"**).

You're looking at an Overlay card - it acts as a missing, additional, or a changed piece of the Dreamscape. You have to place this card on the
Dreamscape immediately. How? Look closely and match it with the grid and the code (it's written on the Overlay card and the Dreamscape, e.g., A1, B2, etc.). Remember to match it precisely, even if this means placing it "askew," at a strange angle.

Place all miniatures and tokens, which would be otherwise covered by the Overlay card, on top of it.

Done? It should fit quite right. The card may look strange at first, but it really has to be placed at this angle.

What has changed? There's a **new Wall** that encloses 2 spaces. Will it be useful for something? You'll find out soon, probably.

**If the Trap card is revealed:** You may discard the Trap card and return it to the Secrets of this Dream. As you see, you may use this action to open or close this Trap.


# 31
*What is lost, stays forever in the Dreamlands. Places, scenes, buildings, basements, photos, and boxes full of whatever happened to us. You stand and wait in the rain for eternity. You burn in fire forever. You watch souvenirs, you constantly look for a way, you try to run away, you meet your loved ones, although they are not quite present. The places here are eternal, and although everything is changing, these are only collages of the same memories. Understanding is the key to escape from suffering and nightmares. But how to get this key?*

**Unseal 1 card** or **Unflip 1 Progress card**.

**OR**

Move the **Clock Hand** clockwise by a number of slots indicated by the current Turn Suit (See Dream Gate tile).


# 32
*The door is so familiar that I instinctively push the door handle - it just feels like home. Is it possible? Is this my old apartment? Strange... the room layout is correct but someone has rearranged all the furniture. When I see all those changes, I feel a deep sadness. Why does everything have to change over time?*

*It's dirty here, and it smells musty, like in a museum. A scrawny female figure wanders between the furniture like a shadow, wiping the dust from some trinkets. It doesn't make it any cleaner or more pleasant.*

*Her blind gaze stops on us.*

*"It's you? Finally, you came back. Please, help me clean up. See all this mess?... Is that you? Where are you? How come you're not here? You said you would never leave."*

*The woman's gaze stops at a cockroach running through the room.*

*"Help me catch them. My children... So disobedient and afraid of the light. Please, help me find them and bring them back."*


# 33
*The journal doesn't seem like it was finished - loose notes fall out of the book, many chapters contain gaps yet to be filled, margins and empty spaces are filled with crudely-scribbled notes. Every traveller writes something here - and we should also. But for now, let's read a chapter...*

**Choose 1:**
- [...about the observatory] -> (2) .
- [...about the mysterious island] -> (742).
- [...about the Great Sea] -> (153).
- [...about treasures] -> (939).


# 34
*"It smells good. All in all - why not?"*

- You may remove this card from the game to **Remind** twice. Then, move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

- If you change your mind now and don't want to sacrifice any **Lucid Influence cards**, suffer **1** `damage` or **Seal 1 card**.

# 35
*We can see the shadow of a huge figure against the brick wall - but we don't see anyone standing there, as if the shadow existed only by itself. We wonder where it lost its owner.*

*As we approach we can hear a faint whispering from it, so weak we can barely hear the words:* 

*"It was a really special and surprising party. I've never had such a good time in my life. Only something happened... I can't remember exactly what, and somehow I can't go home now. What time is it? Where did everyone disappear to?"*

*In the place where the shadow should have a heart, there is a torn black hole. Ah, but wait, it's an alcove in the brick wall! Something glistens inside.*

You may suffer **1** `damage` to **gain 4** `gem`.

# 37
*Obsessed with the passage of time and passing away forgotten, we collect souvenirs. We are lost in either memories or visions of the future, always absent, always thinking about tomorrow or yesterday. It's like wandering in the dark. But here - at the bottom of the chest lies a lightbulb. Maybe it still works?*

If this is a `light` space, you may add **1 Morphing** to reveal **card E**.

If this is a `night` space - add **1 Morphing** and roll the **Luck die**:

- `luck-x` = **Suffer 1** `damage`. 
- `luck-blank` = **Seal 2 cards**.

Finally, you may Move the **Locker 2 spaces** or **Relocate the Lamp to any tile**.


# 38
*As we approach the destroyed wall, we see a monster trotting around like a hen in the nearby square.*

- **Seal 3 cards** or **Relocate the Scarecrow to your space**.


# 39
*The beast hides somewhere in the darkness and seems to hit the water every minute, causing powerful waves to ripple outwards. We think this is its way of hunting - so it must have already sensed potential prey.*

*One thing is certain - it avoids light like it's fire. Let's try to move the beacon headlamp and hit the creature with a ray of light.*

- Dreamers on **A1** may Seal a total of `player` cards to **discard 1 Morphing**.


# 41
*We try to focus on the present...*

If there are 2 or more Webs on the **Dark Borders** tile - *We can only think of yesterday's failures and of tomorrow's uncertainties. However, we're so focused on the future that we make a half a dozen plans.* 

- You may draw *up to* **5 influence cards** (even if you would exceed your usual Hand Limit!) and discard any number of them (you may have a maximum of your usual Hand Limit of cards in hand after this action).

If there are fewer than 2 Webs on the **Dark Borders** tile - *The air is chilly, blood circulates in our weary veins, we're hungry - all of this happens now. And now is the hour of power.* 

- Gain **card D**.


# 43
*The voice from the roof is getting stronger.*

*"Stop being such a wimp! Grow up, the world is brutal, and that's good! Nobody will pity you! You'll never make it! Do you think I didn't climb this tower by myself? So how did I get here?"*

- Discard 1 `gem` or gain 1 `threat` and add it to your `damage` pool - in this Dream treat `threat` in the same way as `damage`. 

- Gain 1 `gem` or 1 Story token.


# 44
*We rise from the ground and, without looking back, we move on.*

# 45
*A huge cloud of black birds swirls omninously above the roof. From afar they look like an angry ancient demon. Every sound is drowned out in the hum of a thousand voices - everything except a tired, feeble voice coming from inside.*

*"I sacrificed everything for you... Don't you remember? You have always been ungrateful and useless. And now you don't even want to help me when I need you this one time..."*

- Discard the **Water! card** to the Secrets of this Dream.

# 46
*We stand in front of the path leading down a winding staircase. We hear a splash of water below.*

- Reveal **tile Z**.


# 48
***Chapter III: Contact***

*[Strange voice] "Warm... Warm light... Warm life... We need life... Need your life...*

*"Repeat!"*

*[Strange voice] "Hunger... And pain..." [noise]*

*"Where exactly are you now?"*

*[Strange voice] "Here... All the time here..."*

*"Are... Are you alive?..."*

*[strange voice] "Not alive... Not dead... Eternal." [noise]*

*The remnants of unnatural life disappear, all movement ceases. The signal is gone. There's only silence.*

See the [epilogue] -> (755).


# 49
*"I once had big plans and dreams - just like you. Do you think I didn't have any? Ha ha... You know nothing. You won't go far with your dreams! These are fantasies, and only fools follow them! Don't be so stupid!"*

*We answer quietly, more to ourselves.*

*"You'll be surprised then."*

*Through the window, we see a human shadow somewhere high on the roof. It is surrounded by a swirl of black crows. Also, a plank resembling a springboard protrudes from the roof.*

- Gain **1** `gem` or **1 Story token**.

- Reveal **card I (Crow Monster)** unless it's already revealed.


# 50
*Was this a potential victim? Is this even worth the risk? Is it a mistake? The hand grasps us with an iron grip, but instead of trying to get out, it pulls us in, deeper and deeper...*

**Seal 4 cards.**

*Or maybe it's just desperately fighting for life?*

**Choose 1:**

- \- *We must help* - **Seal 2 more cards** and [resolve] -> (725)

- \- *‘Not for anything in the world! I'm fed up with helping out. - The hand disappears after a while.*

# 51
*We channel all our energy and coil it into a single stream of crystalline concentration. We break free of gravity and of our problems. Our spirits drift above the ground like when we were children.*

Gain **card E**.


# 52
*The forest is dark, but not dead. It is the ancient cradle of life, the source of all existence. The deeper we go and the higher we climb, more strange murmurs reach our ears. Trilobites, lizards, and other primitive life forms crawl among the trees. Sometimes, something much younger flies through the fog - a wolf or a primitive man. We could live here, catch old fish in misty ponds and hunt small animals. However, we would also be prey for the beasts hidden in the darkness. We miss the light so much... We actually don't want to be here any longer.*

- Each Dreamer gains **1 random card** from the **Influence Market**.

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.


# 53
*The stone bounces off the glass and falls to the ground.*

*Someone turns on the light inside and we can see their silhouette at the window. It disappears after a while but the light remains. That's good. Every smallest ray is our ally against the crawling darkness.*

- Spawn **1 Tentacle (*use Creature Shapeshifter*)** on this tile and roll for its Movement.

- Reveal **card B**.


# 54
After resolving the **Out of Turns** effects from the current Slumber tile:

- \- Each Dreamer **Unseals all cards** and **reshuffles their deck**.
- \- If there are fewer than **3** `ether` on the Dream Gate tile, each Dreamer returns 1 random Influence card from their deck to the Influence Market.
- \- Reshuffle the Slumber and Fate decks.
- \- Discard all `ether` from the Dream Gate tile.
- \- Your Arena cycle ends - resolve **Awakening**.

Keep this Dream Gate tile - you may enter the **Arena** whenever you want.

*Unfortunately, you didn't gain any prizes this time.*


# 56
*We speak with an older, bored vampire - we touch on politics and the future of our world, befriending him surprisingly fast. His beliefs and desires are surprisingly similar to ours. With each word the vampire speaks, clouds of mist flow out his mouth - when we look around, we see nothing but this dense, milky fog.*

If there's `threat` in *range 1*, suffer **1** `damage`.

*Finally, the vampire makes a proposal - he gives us the choice that they have never had.*

You *may* gain **card H (Vampire)** and **card I (Vampire curse)**. If you decide to, you must gain both cards.


# 57
*"Our" tree is no more. It's gone. There are no more apples. It's been a long time since I've had something sweet to eat. Or tasty.*

*But now is not the time to cry over a tree, I have to go on.*

You may **Flip 1 Progress cards** to add **1 Turn**.


# 58
*"What are you doing here? How did you get in here? You better scram - this house has been torn apart by some madman and it's about to collapse, can't you see?"*

You may **Seal** the **"I'll rip everything" card** to discard **all Morphings**.


# 59
*We catch a glimpse of something shiny under a thick layer of dust.* - Gain **1** `gem`.

*Ouch! Damn, how many of these glass shards are there around?* - If this is a `night` space, spend **2** `red` or suffer **1** `damage`.

*Then, we hear a buzz on our left - there's a small neon lamp in the shape of a leaf. What could it mean?*

*And again, there is movement in the dark, as if something was leaning around the corner!* - If this is a `night` space, place **1** `threat` in this space (max. 1 `threat` per space).


# 61
*While most of the city is cramped and stacked up to the sky, it is refreshing to enter this more open space with wider, almost empty streets, spacious pavements and low office buildings surrounded with hedges. It looks like a concrete desert drenched in sunlight. There is a tall monument on each square - Big Flower, Blue Octopus, First Rocket to Pluto, and so on.*

*While we're looking for a nice place to satisfy our hunger, a passer-by hands us a leaflet.*

Gain card **II-34 O (Storekeeper Note card)** if it is still available **OR** Settle any 1 Business from any spaces.


# 63
*The water is dense and resembles unpleasant sludge. And it stinks! Tons of plastic bottles and packages make an morbid grave for dead fish and other sea creatures, which foolishly thought they would find shelter here. We recognize some of the rubbish we tossed away in our lifetime but, fortunately, there's not much of it.*

- You may purify the water a bit - **Seal 2 cards** to **add 1 Turn**.


# 64
*The boat rises and falls on raging waves, barely visible through the veils of heavy rain, then finally drifts away into the storm and disappears, sailing all alone into the distance...*

Discard the **Personal token (the Kid)** and return **card D (Kid in a boat)** to the Secrets of this Dream.

- Each Dreamer **Seals 1 card**.


# 65
*A huge cloud of black birds swirls omninously above the roof. From afar they look like an angry ancient demon. Every sound is drowned out in the hum of a thousand voices - everything except a tired, feeble voice coming from inside.*

*"I sacrificed everything for you... Don't you remember? You have always been ungrateful and useless. And now you don't even want to help me when I need you this one time..."*

- Discard the **Water! card** to the Secrets of this Dream.


# 66
*The fractured stone floor stretches far and fades into the dark. We can rest here for a while, on the border of eternal night. A wobbly path lies ahead of us, and behind us, only an endless void awaits. There is no light here - we have to find it within ourselves.*

- You may discard **1 Turn** - then each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.


# 67
*The thing screaming on the roof can't be a human.*

*"You are to obey! If you don't, get out! You know nothing! And I have already lived through my years, I know this and that! You are the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my whole life!"*

- Discard **1** `gem` or gain **1** `threat` and add it to your `damage` pool - in this Dream treat `threat` in the same way as `damage`.

- Gain **1**`gem` or **1 Story token**.


# 69
*The voice on the roof is slowly fading away and... aging? However, we can hear it clearly - we have to be closer to its source.*

*"You've wasted my life... I could have done a lot, but I didn't have a chance because of you... Why do you exist at all? I hate you!"*

- Gain **1** `gem` or **1 Story token**.

- Reveal **card I** (Crow Monster) unless it's already revealed.


# 70
***Ship's log 10.***

*I haven't seen anything for a long time. Absolutely nothing.*

*Maybe space is not empty, but it is for me. I am like a grain of sand in the desert, smaller than an ant in the vast oceans. I will never leave, not in this vehicle and in this body. Too many restrictions of scale and distance and not enough time. I won't find anything further, even if my journey lasts a thousand years. There is nothing but darkness, silence, and emptiness.*

*It is like a land of absolute and final death. It's like floating in a void...*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`.

- Gain **1 Hour**.

- Cross out the number on the **"Reading the Ship's log"** and write a new one: **"220."**


# 72
*The mighty whirlpool makes us circle around something, closer and closer to it... We rub our eyes, cannot believe what we see.*

*It's a tower, certainly. But it grows out of the clouds, hanging upside-down from above, its roof brushing against the water. We are so close... And, yes, we grab the railing and pull ourselves into the room. Everything is inverted - we stomp on the ceiling with upside-down chairs and furniture above us. A magnificent chandelier rolls between our legs, its diamond parts jingling merrily. There is one sound out of tune - it's a glass key between the diamonds. It should open the door to the Observatory.*

- Gain **1 Story token**.


# 73
*No, we won't come here today, as we're not ready. But even now, as dusk falls, one of the houses attracts our attention. We've seen it before. Maybe in a photo?*

Gain **II-39 P ("Something lurks in the Dark" Dream Gate tile)** if it is still available **OR** Settle any 1 Business from any spaces.


# 74
*The beast is in the right place! Now the chains lying there... they're broken but that's why we're here. We might not have noticed it before but through all of our journeys and various dreams, we've been carrying these chains almost from the very beginning. For this one purpose at this specific place and time.*

*Do you see them now?*

- Reveal **tile X**. Place **Belshazar** in the special slot in the centre of that tile - from now on, Belshazar is treated as if it stands in each of the 4 spaces of the tile. Until the end of this Dream, it cannot leave this place in any way.

- If there were any Dreamers in this area, place them in any spaces on **tile A3**.

- Reveal **card B**.

*Beware - each card used to chain the beast will be lost forever!*


# 75
*They have a large selection of goods here. There are several doors at the back of each shop — each leads to another store. It doesn't seem to end.*

- Gain 1 **chosen** Item from the **Item Market**.


# 76
*"By the way, if you want to buy a boat, I could sell you mine. I'm not planning on sailing anymore, I'll stay here till the end - I like this place. Give me a moment though, I just have to check it as I haven't used it for a while. Come back later, we'll come to an agreement for sure. Just don't forget the cash."*

*Hint: If you have enough `gem` at the end of this Dream, you will be able to gain* ***card I (The Boat)***


# 77
*One could hide under the stairs. What should we hide from? If we don't know yet, then don't worry about doing this.*

If the **Crow Monster** is on the Dreamscape and if there are any **cards B** available - gain **1 card B**, discard the **Crow Monster**, and return its card to the Secrets of this Dream.


# 78
*After a while, there is only quiet darkness in his place. May he be safe.*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.


# 79
*We approach someone who looks like the leader of the local gang. He is surrounded by many shadows, constantly whispering into his weary ear.*

*"Do I know you?" His cold gaze stops us in our tracks.*

- If you have a **Story token**, you may discard it to [resolve] -> (114).

- Otherwise, suffer **1** `damage`, and if there's `threat` in **range 1**, discard your **Mask**.


# 81
*"You know, this job is soooo boring. The other guy can at least wander around. Me? I just look at the stars, or at least I try... but with all this fog and smoke... How could one disperse the mist?"*

*He sighs.*

*"Some friendly advice - don't try entering without a permit. Don't give me that, ‘But I must get my package!' and all that pleading and whining. They order me to beat people like that - and I do it. It's nothing personal, it's just a job."*

- You may **Seal 1 card** to **draw 4 influence cards**.


# 82
*It will help for a while, but every moment of life is precious, especially for those who have so little left. The cat meows happily and walks around the dark room.*

- Each Dreamer may **Seal 2 cards** to cure **1** `damage` or to gain **1** `ether`.


# 83
You may close the Door - place a `block` token on the *Open Door slot*. **Closed Doors** are treated as a solid **Wall** in this Dream. If you closed the Door - neither Entity nor Dreamers may move through this Wall.

You don't have to remember this as a new rule for the whole game - it's an example of a special rule, which applies only in this Dream. Treat it as an additional special rule of this Dream.

And if you want to, you may open the Door if it was *closed* - discard the `block` token. You may open and close the Door as many times as you want, but you have to pay the action cost each time.


# 84
*We hear sobbing - someone must be in the closet. A figure hides behind old clothes. It turns out to be a tall cockroach wearing a female evening gown. It sobs like a human.*

*You may try to calm it down.* Spend **1** `gem` to [resolve] -> (944).

Or, if you have **card B (Realization of the sad truth)**, you may spend 1 `red`, to get rid of this cockroach once [and for all] -> (783).

Or you may just *leave the creature in the closet*.


# 86
*We notice patterns in our lives, and we see what makes us commit the same mistakes over and over again. But do we see it clearly? A misinterpretation would lead to a disaster! We should stick to our habits, shouldn't we? Or do we have enough faith in ourselves to break this sick pattern?*

If you have the **Faith** card, place **2** `marker` on your Dreamer board.

Otherwise, discard all cards with `yellow` Intent from your hand.


# 87
*What awaits us behind this gate? We carry the knowledge and memories of the lost world. We are like an impulse providing information to a forgotten organ, like a messenger with a mysterious package looking for the address written on it. We were supposed to get there, but what happens when we finally cross the border? Is there a chance that this will change anything?*

*We reminisce about the old world once again. It was not always a beautiful place - or rather, it was rarely like that. Ruined lives, constant pain and fear holding many of us in their cruel grasp, though there were also many brighter sides. Do we really want to come back to it? Is it even possible? And even if it could work, what will happen to us then? We feel somewhere deep inside that nothing good is waiting for us on the other side.*


# 88
*I don't like looking in the mirror. I'm afraid to see my forgotten sins or something sinister behind me. Mirrors can be gates to the other side. But we're probably already on the other side, so...*

*This one is so dirty that almost nothing is reflected.*

If there is still a **card J** in the Secrets of this Dream, you may gain it to gain **6** `gem`.

**OR**

You may suffer **2** `damage` to gain **6** `gem`.


# 89
*The storm approaches and violently veers towards us - the last, desperate act of hatred in order to sweep us from the ocean's surface and protect the mysteries that were not meant for us. Waves become sharp like razors and strike us relentlessly like a hammer striking an anvil. The water gets choppier and starts to pull us into its depths. But it's all in vain, dear storm! You won't win against us, we know your weaknesses - we know how to fight you. And finally it decides to yield and calms down. The unwrinkled surface of the ocean invites us to glide towards the Great Sea.*

Discard **1** `gem` or suffer **1** `damage`. Discard the tile from **C1** (even if it's the **Port tile**).


# 90
*The twenty-first century - when the world died. What's this about? In the pictures, we see a world that we know well - ordinary cars, colourful newspapers, mundane mobile phones, fashionable glasses, buzzing drones and so on. Are these exhibits? What's the year here?*

*However, this is nowhere to be found. Even when we ask around, people look at us with suspicion. "Which year? You're a funny one..." This world is glued together from fragments of different eras, just like the museum's wild assortment - maybe there's no specific date at all?*

*We are starting to understand but these thoughts make us queasy.*

- Each Dreamer may suffer **1** `damage` and **Seal 3 cards** to gain **1** `ether`.


# 91
*A strange, weak voice and indistinct words* "Gi... Bri..." *more incoherent noises*

*"Repeat! We can hear you, but you have to repeat! Where are you? We sense your presence here in the laboratory!"*

*A sudden system crash flashing on the computer screen. Something interrupts the decoding leaving a silence behind. A small flame ignites and starts melting the cable.*

- This computer is **damaged** - mark it with `threat`.


# 92
*We knock, and the door opens after a while. "What? You need a quick loan, right? Come on in." The gloomy guy gestures us to a dirty, sleezy interior.*

- You may add **card B** to the **Fate deck**. If you do so, each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.


# 93
*The gigantic wave breaks above us and slowly, as if it were made of honey, approaches, ready to crush us. Then, it stops and says:*

*"Give me something. Something precious. And I will restore you in return."*

- Each Dreamer may return **1 Influence card** (from hand or Discard pile) to the Influence Market to cure **all** `damage` or **Unseal all cards**.


# 94
*From the upper floors of the block, we can make out something at the bottom of the hole - the bones of a giant dinosaur; their colour contrasting against the dark soil. If such a thing were still alive, it could destroy the entire city.*

*But what are these strange devices emitting pulsating blue lights down there? What is this team in white overalls up to? It would be better to keep our distance.*

*Oddly enough, the landscape changes every now and then. This is probably one of the places where strong anomalies cause different versions of the future to materialise closely together on top of one another.*

- Gain **card E (Anomaly)** if it is still available **OR** Settle any 1 Business from any spaces.


# 95
*The ship looks like a giant cradle - would you fall asleep easily when it starts to sway? On the other hand, it also reminds us of a floating circus - maybe people have crazy fun instead during voyages?*

*But it doesn't look like it's sailing anywhere soon - there are holes in its hull, and the rudder is broken. It must have lived through many adventures and seen a great many parts of the world before docking here.*

*Sometimes, even such a damaged ship can wander through the sea - there's one like that on the horizon. It sinks slowly though. Orders are orders, and the crew cannot do anything but listen. Sounds of fun and laughter carry across the wind, even though the ship will be gone soon. When a ship sinks, it does not matter who is at the helm.*

*But, wait - our minds drifted too far away. Back to land now.*

- Gain **2** `gem`.

*We hear a grim voice: "Who goes there? Stop! Show your papers!"*

- Relocate the **Warden** to this space. Add **1 Morphing**.


# 96
*Not yet. Not yet!*

*We run through the renovated building door, and the apocalyptic clamour slowly ceases. This world will prevail.*

Gain **card F (Shortcut to the city)** if it is still available **OR** Settle any 1 Business from any spaces.


# 97
*It's nine o'clock. Goodbye. See you soon.*

- Reveal **card C**.


# 98
*We enter the abandoned room through one of the broken windows. An old desk we encounter tells us that that this is the place where the strange blind violinist played his crazy compositions, its drawers sliding in and out with each word.*

*When the desk goes silent, we realise that it is an ordinary, dead piece of furniture. Furniture can't speak. It's almost funny.*

*We can open the desk and look for something useful.*

- You may discard **1** `gem` or **Seal 2 cards** to **Restore 1 Item**.


# 99
*We stand in silence and observe the youngster, who smears the wall with an orange substance. It's a drawing, or maybe a signature of some kind. The wall slowly transforms, taking on more colors. It's like a gate to another world through which this young artist tries to escape from this gloomy neighborhood. How otherwise can they even know of such worlds?*

*Never mind, it's nice to look at.*

- **Unseal 1 card**.


# 100
*We were here again just for a moment and in that moment understood everything again. Unfortunately we have to move on once more - and as soon as we leave, we'll lose this waking state forever again. There is more to be done but we have to go back to the shadows. If we succeed, we'll come back here - and stay, maybe, hopefully forever.*

*We are reviewing the journal of our journey - everything we have experienced in the years after our arrival, all of our adventures and the information we have obtained.*

*We know where we can find the missing element with which the world can return to its original form and maybe be real again. The secret lies not in the keys but in the wall itself. The one reality that never existed. There was only one big dream, inviolable, eternal and common to all. A powerful dream surrounded by a stalwart wall that separated it from all other unstable dreams and their rulers.*

*We need to leave the home we reclaimed and move on to explore the dreams surrounded by the strongest wall - the most stable and resistant to our presence. We must discover the secret of the walls.*

*We'll be leaving soon, but for now - let's rest here for a while...*

<u>*Victory.*</u> Each Dreamer may find and remove **all their Flaws**.

- Dreamers may choose any 1 card from the **Fate deck** or from the **Slumber deck** and *remove it from the game*.

**You have completed the first campaign.**

You may save the game now, or just go straight into the second campaign if you want by resolving the Awakening card.


# 101
You're resolving the **Awakening card** now, and you decided to change your Dreamers.

**If you're playing solo:**
- \- choose any other Dreamer.

**If there are more players:**
- \- a player may choose a Dreamer that isn't currently used by any other player

- \- Dreamer boards,
- \- Influence cards specific to those particular Dreamers (keep the rest of the Influence cards),
- \- Lucid mode deck and Lucid mode Dreamer board if you have them.

**Then, each player takes all elements of their new Dreamer:**
- \- miniature,
- \- Personal token,
- \- Dreamer board,
- \- Influence cards with the back specific to their Dreamer.
- \- First memories card if it is still available to this Dreamer (**cards II-41 L**)
- \- Lucid mode deck and Lucid mode Dreamer board if you have them.

Note that if anyone chose the **Free Spirit**, also take the **Spirit tokens**. If the Free Spirit is now unused, put the Spirit tokens back in the box.


# 102
*Phew, there's a storage room full of oars below deck! If only we had more hands!*

- Discard the **current Turn card**.


# 103
*Friendship is about mutual loyalty and I know I can count on you. Remember, if you put in a good word for me, then every piece of furniture in the world will help you.*

- Peek at **card L**.


# 104
*The gallery barely holds, the floor is almost all holes and rust. Each step must be taken extremely carefully. At the end we can see a passage.*

If you want to **Relocate** to a random place - roll the Luck die:

- `luck-x` = You haven't moved at all.
- `luck-blank` = Relocate to the `spawn` space.
- `luck-1`/`luck-2` = Relocate to a `start` space.
- `luck-3` = Relocate to any chosen space.

*The line is cast. After a short moment, something takes the bait. It seems that keyfish love shiny lures.*

Gain **1 Key**.

Then, [resolve] -> (76).


# 106
*The steel machine stops, parts crumble and oil pours out of the gaping wounds in the armour. Is there something inside...?*

Roll the **Luck die**:

This Slumber ends.


# 107
*Something lurks in the darkness! Such monstrous silhouettes!* - If this is a `night` space, place 1 `threat` in this space (max. 1 `threat` per space).


# 108
*It's so comforting - so bright and warm and I really feel alive. Suddenly, something deep in my memories awakens and a cold shiver runs down my spine. The lost memory comes back with full force and leaves just as quickly, only a vague trace remaining.*

*It's hard to forget the touch of cold darkness and emptiness. The pain after the memory still paralyses my whole body. There was something else...*

*Blurred videos and overwhelming fear. "I don't want to see it..." I walk down the dark tunnel towards the light, hesitantly, as if I never wanted to leave it. A deep sense of sadness haunts each footstep.*

*I find myself in a room - some laboratory - deep lethargy overcomes my body and compels me to turn on the TV. A blurry video...*

*Ha ha, it's definitely not me. I feel that these are clearly not my memories. Rather I tuned into someone else's mind-waves and saw their soul by reading something that didn't belong to me. Well, no thank you, I prefer mine - cheerful and light.*

- Gain 1 `ether`.


# 109
*After a long moment, we begin to understand that we cannot hide from the darkness. Regret and  hopelessness embrace us with their grim tendrils.  We've lost so much precious time - we have no chance now and it's too late for anything.*

*The darkness passes us by. It doesn't notice us. It takes a moment for the dark thoughts to leave our minds.*

- Block 1 Step on the current **Turn card**.


# 110
*We jump into the water and catch the floating crate. Then, we notice the awful smell of the water and rotting garbage. "Sigh - there's always pollution." Suddenly, something grabs us by the legs and starts to pull...*

- Seal 2 cards or suffer 1 `damage`.

Do you have the **Real Treasure card**?
- [Yes] -> (223)
- [No] -> (544).


# 111
*The darkness lasts forever. We open our eyes. It's hard to see anything in the dark. After a while, we start to distinguish some green shapes - we're floating in a room flooded with water. Other bodies covered with algae drift around us, moving ever so slightly. The walls are metallic and covered with strange sunken devices. Through small windows, we can see what is outside - a misty moonless night sky and a tall wall of a hill overgrown with forest to one side. On the other side, the barren land stretches endlessly...*

*The door opens and, carried by a powerful wave, we scramble out, landing in the mud in front of the building.*

**Choose 1:**

- \- [*Let's go towards the forest* - each Dreamer shuffles their deck (adding cards from hand / Discard pile / Sealed cards pile first) and returns 1 at random to the Influence Market] -> (52).

- \- [*Let's head towards the barren waste* - any 1 Dreamer returns 1 of their Masks to the pool (and returns its Mask card to the Secrets)] -> (359). 

- \- [*Let's stay where we are*] -> (662).


# 112
*Each time we look in the mirror, we see something completely different. And this time is the worst.*

*There's no face in the reflection. Instead there is only a mask. A mask that covers what should be hidden. Then the mask starts to crumble away, revealing what is underneath...*

- Reveal **card B**.


# 113
*The strange old man stares into the endless distance. We notice that he is blind. Or maybe he actually sees everything in a completely different way. His face is reminiscent of the wizened statues of ancient deities from the time when humanity was just crawling. We have a hunch that he is more than just an ordinary stranger or a resident here. What is he really?*

*"You look but you cannot see. Because the truth is always hidden."*

- Each Dreamer may suffer 2 `damage` to Unseal 6 cards or gain 6 `gem`.


# 114
*"Right, I know you... We can talk. What do you want?"*

Relocate **2 spaces down and 1 space right**.

Gain 1 `gem`.


# 116
*Uh, the stench. Damn, there is so much garbage here! Disgusting...* - If this is a `night` space, Seal 2 cards.

*I wonder what the neon sun was supposed to symbolise... Never mind.*

*When our sight adapts to the shadows, we're able to discern some details. If we look closely, we may spot danger before it could harm us, or maybe we can even find a hidden chest unsullied by anyone's greedy hands.*


# 117
*Our protege stands proud under the balcony. He puffs out his chest and yells like crazy:*

*"Hey, you! Come out to see me! Come out!"*

*He's not doing well, that much is obvious.*

*Something moves behind curtains, and the youngster quickly unfolds a crumpled piece of paper. He reads it loudly, screeching a little:*

*"It's like the sunrise! But your cheeks are the sun. Your visage, I mean. Visage is your sun! Oh, pretty sun, come out. Go on, geez!"*

*An ashy, disgusted face leans out the balcony. The answer to our protege's whining is short and merciless:*

*"Guards! Get him, he's here! GUARDS!"*

- Any 1 Dreamer may suffer 1 `damage` to add 1 Turn.

- Each Dreamer gains 1 `ether`.

- Resolve the front side of **card A**.

*"Don't worry about me. I will be careful."*

- Each Dreamer may Seal 3 cards to cure 1 `damage`.


# 119
*Let's look at this dream...*

*The gentle rays of the sun envelop the green hills, the wind dances over waving fields of grain. Someone is walking down the path, crossing a small wooden bridge. An angler sits on the shore, feeding hungry fish with the nursing rod. In the distance, a dog runs across the path, wagging its tail. One small cloud obscures the sun for a moment, but after a while, it moves further away like a milky stain on a blue canvas.*

*Rating: Well, this is beautiful! Soothing... And how calming! It's really worth a lot of mud.*

- Place **1 Story token** on the Dream Gate tile.

- Each Dreamer may cure 3 `damage`.

- If the **Union Leader** is not revealed, [resolve] -> (330).


# 120
*The Moon Baroness studies the silver spoon with satisfaction. However, when the promised payment comes, we are disappointed.*

*"But what do you mean? It's a silver key, as I promised."*

*"It's not even painted silver... It's blue..."*

*"Really? I was sure it was silver... Well, my mistake. Then I'll add something else and let's leave in friendship."*

*We don't get anything else here.*

*[Strange voice] "Warm... Warm light..."*

*"We're losing communication with you! We're running out of the energy needed to keep in touch. Can you hear us? Repeat! Can you see us? Are you here with us? Give us any sign of life!"*

*The computer cannot stand the strong signal and, with a dry click, turns off - a black, dead screen is the only thing left.*

- This computer is damaged - mark it with `threat`.


# 122
*Our problems... They seem insignificant, but they are plenty real to us. Why does no one understand that? Why do they try to push us to do things we don't want to? Because of them, we don't trust ourselves, we think we are not good enough. How wonderful it would be not to expect anything from ourselves...*

- If you have the ***Here and Now*** card, you may discard **1 Web** in range 1 of *each* Spider.

- Otherwise, resolve the ***Heavy Thought*** effect (if it's active).


# 123
*A shot in the dark, wasn't it?*

- Each Dreamer flips *all* their Progress cards. Then, discard 1 Turn.

# 125
*Director Pig is in his bathtub. When he sees us, he jumps to life not even worrying about his modesty.*

*"Finally! You certainly took your time, didn't you? I called you an hour ago! The heart needs medicine and fast! Take the equipment and go. I don't remember where they landed. Eh, these unreliable deliveries... You order, you pay, and they deliver it anywhere. I will sue them. I will sue everyone if something happens to the Mill, you'll see!"*

- Add **2 Turns** or each Dreamer cures 1 `damage`.

*Hmm. Maybe this is the choice we have to make at the crossroads? Let's try...*

- Reveal **card C** (Mud diving suit).


# 126
*There is an abandoned shopping trolley on the ground. It's seemingly empty. Although... when we look inside again there are some items hiding in a corner.*

- Restore 3 Items.


# 127
*Our legs seem to stretch indefinitely - we take gigantic but clumsy steps. The darkness distorts the room, its dimensions seem to swirl and stretch... It is difficult to say whether we are rushing or barely moving in these pitch-black shadows.*

- Spawn **1 Tentacle** (use Creature Shapeshifter) on this tile and roll for its Movement.


# 128
*"Watch out for the merchant. If only you knew what he was spending money on... His goods may look pretty but half of them are useless junk. You certainly
should not believe in any miracles. Look around. How could you in such a place? By the way, contrary to what some people say, there are no rats here. You see, we certainly aren't rats..."*


# 129
- [Is this a **Secret card** from this Dream?] -> (394).

- [Or a Dreamer **Influence card?**] -> (323).

- [Or a non-Dreamer **Influence card** (without any Dreamer's special rule on its back)?] -> (559).

- [Or an **Item** from the **Storage**?] -> (25).

- [Or an **active Item**?] -> (405).

- [Or is this a **tile**?] -> (328).

- [Or **something else**?] -> (237).


# 130
*We are knocked over by the crash of a wave. We stop sliding on our shoes and drift aimlessly on our backs. The sky stares down on us and moves quickly above our heads.*

- Each Dreamer on this tile may **Flip 1 Progress card** to **Unseal 5 cards**.

- Then, Relocate 1 Dreamer from this tile to any other space on the other side of this tile's Wall.


# 131
*The corridor slopes downwards, it's getting harder and harder to get down. We almost slipped off. Lower and lower.*

- Take the **tile Z** with 2 lights on the back and place it on **A4**, face down.

- Place **Exploration tile X** as you want according to the **Exploration rules** on the front of the Dream Gate tile. Place all Dreamers in `start` spaces on this tile.

- Place both **Exploration tiles Y** as you want according to the rules of this Dream.

- Remove the **tile Z** with 3 lights on the back from the game.

Now you may continue the Exploration.


# 132
*A shot in the dark, wasn't it?*

- Each Dreamer **Seals 6 cards**. Then, discard 1 Turn.


# 133
*We enter the door on the box, and a bright light engulfs us. And then, the woods, the creature, the underground chamber, the game - everything disappears - we leave it all somewhere far behind.*

*We're in a rift, filled with nothing but light. We crawl out...*

*We're no longer in the forest. It dissolves into the past, like a dream after awakening. We're in a city now. But... Can we wake up inside a dream? If we're awake, we shouldn't be dreaming, but our surroundings suggest otherwise.*

*This city is unlike any we know. Houses scrape a sky full of bulky airships. The moon is too large or too close, and a huge, mechanical construction connects it to the ground. Neon lamps buzz and sparkle, inviting us to step inside colourful shops. Someone approaches - a mixture of human and rat.*

*"Ah, never mind. For a brief moment, I thought you didn't have a face. You have one, right? Such a silly idea! Sorry," the creature says and shakes a bottle in its hand. "Have a wonderful night, person-with-a-face."*

- <u>***Victory.***</u> Each Dreamer cures **2** `damage` and **Unseals 2 cards**. Remember that to **unseal cards** you take them from the top of your **Sealed Cards** pile and place them into your **Discard Pile**.

*We stand in this gigantic, mysterious city, dumbfounded.*
*And then a memory forms at the edge of our minds.*

- Find all **cards II-41 L**. Each Dreamer gains their corresponding **First Memory card** - these provide each Dreamer with a goal that, when completed, reveals a little bit more about their lost memories. Leftover First Memory cards (related to Dreamers who are not actually in play) are placed in the Storage. If the related Dreamers join the game later, they gain their First Memory card from the Storage.

Now, it's time to change the game slightly. Don't forget to resolve ***all*** of the following steps! There are many of them because, in addition to rewarding you, they will add many basic elements to the game.

1. Set aside **Card D** and **TILES S & T** *remaining from the Dream*. Then discard the current Dreamscape (the map tiles on the board currently) and remove from the game all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks), as well as the **Dream Gate tile** of this Dream. If there are any **Item Cards** that you *did not find* (***hint: did you check the floorboards?***), add them to the **Item Market** (separate to the Item Deck). There is no space for this on the board so place is off to the side where you will remember. You can place the other removed cards in the larger well inside the core game box.

2. Find the 4 **tiles II-36 A**. Two of them have **"Starting"** written on their back side - these are the **2 Setup Slumber Map tiles**, and they are always placed face-up first on the Slumber Map (where the Dreamscape was before). You can do that now. Shuffle the others and make a **Slumber Map deck** from them.

    Note that this **DREAMSCAPE MAP** is separate to the **DREAMWORLD MAP** which we'll be placing later.

    ![Slumber Map](/assets/images/secrets/slumber-map.jpg "Slumber Map")

    The easiest way to remember this difference is to think **DREAMSCAPE = LANDSCAPE** which is *smaller* in scale vs **DREAMWORLD = WORLD** which is *larger* in scale.

3. Find **tiles: II-37 A, B, C, and D**. One of them, **II-37 A**, is a little different (it has a green back), set it aside and shuffle the other tiles. Place this green tile at the bottom of the stack after you've done that and place the deck on the allocated spot on the board (or off to the side if not using a board).

    ![Slumber](/assets/images/secrets/slumber.jpg "Slumber")

    *Where to start our search? Fragments of our previous training break through the barrier of oblivion - we knew that we would be in this situation. Now we have to choose which path to take. We have two options: start an investigation to* ***"find someone who can know what's going on"*** *or rather* ***"look inside ourselves, and maybe there we'll find the answers".*** *So, we can go into the city or meditate on our problems somewhere surrounded by nature.*    

4. Gain **Dream Gates tiles II-39 B ("Not alone in the dark")** and **II-39 O ("I'll never forget those sunshine days")**. These tiles allow you to enter unique Dreams *if you travel to their Locations on the Dreamworld Map tiles and spend the required number of Keys* (more on this later as well). You have a special envelope for keeping Dream Gate tiles.

    ***You'll need several more things to travel through the Dreamworld Map: ***

5. Gain **card D** which we set aside earlier. This is the Dreamworld Map **Wisdom card**. Place it in the **Wisdom cards holder**. You'll use this rules reference as a guide to travel through the **Dreamworld Map** (which we'll cover soon).

    ![Dreamworld Wisdom](/assets/images/secrets/dreamworld-wisdom.jpg "Dreamworld Wisdom")

6. Gain **tiles S and T** which we also set aside earlier. These are your first **2 Dreamworld Map tiles**: **Suburbia** and **Metropolis**. You have to place them in the corresponding spots on the Dreamworld Map board. They represent the *first 2 districts of the Dreamworld.*

7. Each Dreamer gains **3** `ether` ('ether'). If you haven't gained these yet, they represent the experience Dreamers can gain as they explore the Dream World. They can be used to buy additional Influence Cards and to pay for certain other effects. To spend these you'll need:

8. Gain the **3 cards II-41 C**. These are **Note cards** so you should keep them in the Storage. These particular 3 cards allow you to make purchases if you're in a **Shopping Location** on the Dreamworld Map. When you go shopping for influence cards, **draw 3 Influence cards** from the **influence market deck** and buy as many of these as you want, paying their `ether` costs. If you choose to buy none, you gain a `gem` instead. Shopping for items is similar - except you only **draw 1 random item** from the **Item Market deck** and the cost to obtain it is **2** `ether`. You *may* have no items available currently depending on whether you found them in the 1st Dream or not. 

    ***A little more to go.***

9. Find the **6 cards II-41 I** and make a **Seasons deck** from them. Place it on the Seasons slot - you can find it near the Dreamworld Map board. Seasons will change during the campaign, but for now, find the **Ordinary Days** card and place it face-up on the top of the Seasons deck.

10. Find **card II-41 M**. It's the **Awakening Wisdom card** - place it in the Wisdom cards holder. 

11. And now, to begin the campaign, resolve the **Awakening** - just follow the steps on the **Awakening Wisdom card** (except for setting up the Slumber map - you've done that already :) ). **Awakening** is a rest mechanic that can be performed after resolving a location effect on the Dreamworld Map that allows you to restore your Dreamer's stamina, removing their distress and sealed cards at the cost of progress (all their active Progress cards are reset along with losing all keys and `gem`). **Note that at NO point during this do you draw influence cards into your hand.**

12. After you've done that, your team marker should be on the **Awakening Space** on the **B2 Dreamworld Map tile: Suburbia**. [Now what do I do!?] -> (133.1)

![Team Token](/assets/images/secrets/team-token.png "Team Token")

# 134
*We enter an area where most buildings are either covered in red paint or charred black with soot. Everything is covered with a thick layer of cobwebs. The devastation here is so complete that it seems to mirror a blazing emotion that grows inside of us. The more time we spend here, the more we feel like hitting something or lashing out at the world for its injustice.*


# 135
*The mountains are no longer visible. We break through the veil of dense clouds, among which the antediluvian electric snakes are already crawling. The sun shines radiantly, turning darkness into golden light. When we finally regain control of the machine we must make a decision - should we go back or stay here to wait out the storm? Or maybe rise even higher, where we can already see silver stars?*

*Rating: Very, very interesting dream. Wonderful! These nuances, this idea! It will fetch a high price!*

Any **one Dreamer** may replace their **Basic Actions card** for 1 of the available **Advanced Basic Actions cards (II-34 P)**. If they do that, they remove their old Basic Actions card from the game.


# 136
*Operating this computer is not easy - instead of using a keyboard, we have to turn the knobs to select topics of interest. But it's not as bad as it could be considering the equipment is made out of wood and glass tubes.*

*And what can it do? Very little. It is a dull device - no games, only tables, and an endless list of titles. But we can at least learn where the library is and what we can possibly find in it.*

- **Seal 3 cards**.

[If there is no Entity in the Dreamscape] -> (542).

If there is any Entity in the Dreamscape, you may check one of the following topics:

- \- [**discard 2 Turns** to find articles about **comers from the other side**] -> (601).
- \- [**discard 1 Turn** to look for data about the **gate hidden in Endless City**] -> (857).
- \- [**discard 1 Turn** to read about **the Arena**] -> (759).


# 137
- Is it a Terrain token, if there are any on the Dreamscape? - discard it to ***Remind*** once and move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

- Or a `block` token, if there are any on the Dreamscape? - *"Noooo thanks, dude..."*

- [Or a Sign token?] -> (350).

- [Or something else?] -> (424).


# 138
*"But I might be able to help you a bit here. Wait..." The newcomer tampers with a strange silver device. "Adjust this place a little?"*

- Any Dreamer may discard 1 `ether` to: **Block 1 Step** on the **current Turn card**, then Discard `threat` from all spaces in range 1 of each Dreamer.

**OR** 

*We leave the stranger - we can manage without his help.*


# 139
*Things that were disgusting and repulsive now seem appealing - we notice the hidden beauty and the unspeakable truth under the filthy coat. The more we understand, the more we want to dig into this phenomenon. We must return to the Red Neighborhood. Then, we have to revisit the Yellow and Green ones. We must try everything each of these filthy districts has to offer. The rest doesn't matter anymore...*

- <u>*Failure.*</u> Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets. 

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream - you can still come back here to try again.

- Discard **all Story tokens** gained in this Dream.

- Each Dreamer gains **1 Flaw** and discards all their `ether`. 

- Change the Season to **Season of Emptiness**.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.

# 140
*I don't like the "dark passage". It stinks so bad and there are a lot of spiders. There are no bad people there though and I can go very far without being hassled - almost the whole two streets.*

You may suffer **1** `damage` to **Relocate to any space on A2**.


# 141
**Chapter I: Signal**

*A shrill scream makes us spill the burning coffee on our hands. "Yes! We have it! We have the signal! We recorded it all! Now just to decypt it...!"*

*We all wear white overalls and hold cups of black, fragrant coffee. Our eyes are focused on the antenna. Indeed, the signal diode glows green, and the printer spits long tapes of gibberish. The screen above shows a view from a remote room - a man is lying on a couch, probably sleeping. Cables connect strange devices to his head.*

*We have been sitting here, deep underground, for many days, as if we were sheltering after a nuclear war. We are essential to make everything work correctly. We remember this... But are those real memories at all? Memory, after all, is only a recollection of things we believed actually happened but maybe these were actually implanted in our minds and it wasn't like that at all?*

*Suddenly the antenna's glow intensifies, we hear buzzing, which turns into a prolonged groan and then... a crack, as if an invisible giant in the middle of the room snapped his fingers. The light goes out, all equipment turns off, everything goes quiet and completely dark.*

*After what seems like an eternity, the emergency power supply kicks in and weak red lights slowly turn on...*

- Mark any **1 chosen Equipment** as **Damaged**.

***To make sure that everything is in place - did you place the tiles correctly? Do you have 2 tiles face-up and 3 face-down (with their tile code visible)?***

- If yes, you placed everything in the right way. Remember to not look at the fronts of face-down tiles unless the game instructs you to.


# 142
*We find a place hidden under the waters of the whirlpool. It's a grotto made of a gigantic bubble of air retained by algae and corals. Its floor is finely decorated with colorful, almost phantasmal shells and pearls. Between them, ***a primeval lizard*** sleeps. Should we peek into its dreams?*

- You may discard a total of **5** `marker` from any **Constellation cards**. If you do, each Dreamer may take **1 random card** from the **Influence Market**, and place it next to the board - you will only gain these cards when you achieve **Victory** in this Dream. If you end this Dream in any other way, return them to the Influence Market.


# 143
*We sit down and look at the fountain. We do nothing... It feels... good? But should we rest while there is so much going on? We catch a glimpse of the sun that peeks shyly from between the heavy clouds. The city obtains a little colour for a transiently beautiful moment, and a flowery scent replaces the smell of ash. We would eventually like to see the whole place like this. Shall we rebuild it? Or should we let it go?*

- Gain 1 `gem`.

[If there are fewer than **3 Webs** in the whole Dreamscape] -> (477).


# 144
*"Many adventures await you. And also long journeys, challenges, and puzzles. You are looking for something. You have a mission, I feel it... The chance of a brief shower tomorrow, but the sunny days... Oh, sorry. What? Oh, ok, the mission. Well, I think that your mission is not that simple. It is not ‘You need to fight this, you need to find that, bring something to another place,' and more of that. Maybe this is not that kind of story. I think that your mission is much more subtle. And it is very important - not only for you. For everyone there. And for everyone here. Here, there, and everywhere. Oh, my program is starting, I'm sorry, I have to go!"*

- *The TV character doesn't seem to notice us anymore.*


# 145
*Autumn leaves fall from the sky, at first one by one, then a rustling wave of warm colours that obscures everything. Dense mist rises from the ground, dissolving surroundings into oblivion. Maybe it's better this way?*

<u>*Failure.*</u> 

- Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets. 

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream - you can still come back here to try again.

- Change the Season to **Season of Emptiness**.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 147
*Something hidden is trapped underground, beneath these containers, leeching on people's misfortune. We hear a whisper...*

*"Release me, you won't regret it."*

*It doesn't sound friendly or even human.*

You may add **tile II-37 Z (Scarecrow)** to the Slumber deck. If you do it, each Dreamer may **Unseal 6 cards** or **cure 2** `damage`.


# 149
*Phew, we managed to push our way up to the front of the line!*

- *Mark this line with `marker`.*

When there's a Train at this platform, you may try to *depart*. Check the conditions on how to get on a Train on the Dream Gate tile.


# 150
*"I like to look at them all, these funny lands, especially when outsiders - like us - come here. I like this world, mixed with illusion and retro."*

*"Retro? What do you mean?"*

*"Yup... At first glance, some twenty-first century vibes, I think, perhaps even a bit older."*

*"Wait a minute, what century do you think this should be?"*

*"Well, twenty-third, like ours, but I don't see any trace of modernity. There's too much light here, you know, as if the Sun hasn't died yet. I can't see all of our steel skyscrapers either. It's very retro."*

*When we go our own way, we hear behind our backs:*

*"But..."*

**Choose 1:**
- \- Let's move on - each Dreamer gains 2 `gem`.
- \- [We turn around to listen to this "but"] -> (138).


# 151
*There is still something left in this store - small items which must have been overlooked by the monstrosity and by the looters. Maybe we'll find some bait here, or something that we could use.*

Reveal **tile V (Scavenger)** unless it's already revealed.

You may **Spawn 1 Scavenger** to gain 2 `gem` or to **Restore 1 Item**.


# 152
You may **Seal 6 cards** or spend **10** `red` to put  **1** `block` token on the **Water! card**.

There can't be more than **1** `block` token on the **Water! card**.

The next time you resolve the **Water! card**, discard the `block` token instead of the Floor tile.


# 153
*"Did you know that in order to reach the Great Sea, you have to reach the waters far in the north-west? And one more thing - there is a hidden place from which you can observe the stars. It may only be reached by passing through the raging storm in the Great Sea."*

- Gain 1 `gem`.


# 154
*Here we are, and we need to stretch the old pins a bit after the journey.*

*The view below is breathtaking. We see a school and a quiet town, and the streets have a golden glow in the sun. Only a single, dark cloud hangs on the horizon.*

Relocate the Team to any Location on the Dreamworld map.

<u>*Victory.*</u> Each Dreamer gains *1* `ether`. Each Dreamer cures *2* `damage` or **Unseals 2 cards**.

- Restore 3 Shopping cards (II-41 C).

- Change the Season to **Season of Regeneration**.

- Discard the current Dreamscape. Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets.

- Remove the Dream Gate tile of this Dream from the game, then gain tile **II-40 M ("Return to the sky" Dream Gate tile)**.

- Gain **tile II-40 I ("A long way to school" Dream Gate tile)** and **tile II-40 B ("Today's play: Life")** Dream Gate tile.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers on `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 155
*The bell rings... nothing happens.*

*We hit it harder. Still nothing. Any ideas?*

*Maybe it is a diving bell? Maybe we can find something underneath the surface?*

- Reveal **tile Y** and place **1 Mud** on *every* space of **C3**.


# 156
*We look at the photos found in the old villa: an old photograph of the mighty Dream Factory and the smiling faces of employees during some festivities, sad figures against the background of tangled pipes in a poor neighborhood, a nice garden in front of a house, with a big, empty table in the open air and children's toys scattered around. Autumn leaves fall from the sky. A huge clock covers half of the scene...*

*The clock's gravity attracts us. It's getting bigger and bigger until we finally try to keep our balance on its shifting clock hand.*


# 157
*Sometimes we manufacture something wonderful and at other times our customers find our products average, or even worse. But it's important we constantly make more - the production line should be spitting them out all the time. Some dreams will change people for the better, others the opposite, so ultimately nothing changes. And that's what this is about. All this is temporary anyway.*

<u>*Failure.*</u> Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets. 

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream - you can still come back here to try again.

- Each Dreamer gains **1 Flaw card**.

- Change the Season to **Season of Emptiness**.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 158
*It's too disgusting to describe it out loud. The ritual comes from the distant past - people were deprived of the light of science and morality then - they worshipped primitive nature and bloody cosmic gods. The scariest part, however, is that these forgotten rituals still worked. Haven't we changed for the better? I think this should?*

*However, the price we pay for this power is high.*

- Suffer **1** `damage` and gain **2 Flaws** 

**OR**

- Return this card to the Influence Market.


# 159
Just to make sure - did you multiply the cost by the number of Dreamers? The `player-x` icon means that the cost must be paid as many times as the number of Dreamers to perform this action. Just making sure, as those are your first steps into this world.

If you're **playing alone**, the cost is 3 times 1, so it's still 3 - nothing changes.

If there are **two of you**, the cost is doubled - it's now 6.

If **three**, the cost is now 9.

And so on.

Additionally, as this is a gradual action, you may pay the cost in steps - you don't have to pay it all at once. Of course, if you have enough Intent, you may do it - and use this action. But if you don't have that much (but at least for 1 basic cost - in this case, it's 3 `yellow`) - you may pay it and place 1 `yellow-marker` next to this action. It means it's paid once. When you or other Dreamers pay the rest, then you can use this action.

If you didn't make any mistake and paid the right cost - place 1 `marker` on the Dream Gate tile (the large square card with **"Gate to the First Dream"** on it).

After using this action, discard all the `yellow-marker` that lie next to this action. If not for the `block` icon, you would be able to pay and use this action again to gain another `marker`, but you can't.

The `block` icon before the cost means that you have to mark it with a `block` token after using it for the first time. When there's a `block` token on an action, you can't use it anymore until the end of this Dream.


# 160
*The cockroaches are caught. The slender figure of a woman, more like a shadow than a living person, hugs them as if they were her own children and slowly starts to vanish.*

*"They did not come. Every day is the same. Although... something has changed. Is winter approaching slowly? I like winter... It's already dark. I'll watch TV for a while, and then I should go to sleep. Maybe they will come tomorrow?..."*

<u>*Victory.*</u> Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`. Each Dreamer cures **3** `damage` and **Unseals 3 cards**.

- Add **tile II-36 B** to the Slumber Map deck.

- Add **card J (Winter)** to the Fate deck.

- Restore 3 Shopping cards (II-41 C).

- Change the Season to **Ordinary Days**.

- Discard the current Dreamscape.

- Remove from the game all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks), as well as the Dream Gate tile of this Dream.

*We will not find the answers we are looking for in this house - it's not THIS house. The remnants of the shadow woman slip from the chair and, like a snake, slither beneath the basement hatch. This door... it was there the whole time. How did we only notice it now? A newspaper lies on top of it with the ominous headline, "People have been disappearing into the underground for years. When will the authorities finally seal the entrances?"*

*So... maybe is it here? The symbol of the silver key on the newspaper restores the hope that we are not in the wrong place.*

- Gain **tile II-39 G ("A ship discovered in the basement" Dream Gate tile)**.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers on `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 161
*When the container is half-full, the diodes on its casing glow brightly, and soon, something lights up inside. We hear a humming engine under the floor.*

*The sludge in which we stand gurgles and bubbles ... and suddenly becomes much clearer. We finally get to see the bottom.*

- Reveal **card A** (note: place it to the right of the **Efforts Containers tile**, matching it to the tile).

# 162
*I put my hand into the light, and it seems that I can scoop it like water, pour it out elsewhere, or splash it to the sides - the drops scatter like sparkling stars...*

**Choose 1:**
- \- Place **3** `light` tokens in any spaces in **range 3**.
- \- Gain **3** `gem`.


# 163
*Behind the door spreads an endless hall, crammed from the floor to the ceiling with swirling pipes. We think that the caretaker might have lived here. A bed lies by the door, flanked by a small desk bestrewn with burnt candles. The wall at the other side of the desk is covered with counters and indicators. There is a small metal door at the other end of the hall.*

- If there is a maximum of **3 Floor cards** on the Dreamscape, you may place **1 Floor** of your choice.


# 164
*The station is much bigger than we thought...*

- Reveal **tile X**.

- Reveal **tile Z (Degenerates)** unless it's already revealed. When you reveal **tile Z**, **Spawn `player` Degenerates**.


# 165
*We peer into the green interior of a pipe - a bright glow caresses our faces. Again, these colors! - What could they mean? We try to squeeze in and barely manage - the pipe gets tighter and tighter.*

- Relocate to the `stairs` space on **A4**.


# 167
*"I haven't eaten such a thing yet. Well, you pique my curiosity."*

*Are you sure?* You may return this card to the Secrets, then each Dreamer **Reminds** twice, and after that, move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

- If you change your mind now and don't sacrifice this Note card, suffer **1** `damage` or **Seal 1 card**.


# 168
*There's nothing but nasty garbage floating on the mucky water. It's disgusting, but we can walk on it like on a bedraggled carpet. Suddenly lightning strikes next to us and scatters rubbish in all directions.*

- Spend **1** `gem` or **suffer 1** `damage`.


# 169
*They're closing and we're still here? Visitors are nowhere to be seen, but there are shapes in gray uniforms and weird helmets with black visors. They herd dogs to their kennels and lock them up. They don't look friendly at all.*

*Only a few children are still playing outside the gate, laughing and reciting a nursery rhyme:*

- *"One for sorrow, Two for mirth, Three for a funeral, Four for birth*

- *Five for heaven, Six for hell, Seven for the devil, his own self..."*

<u>*Failure.*</u> 

- Discard the current Dreamscape. Return all I-15 cards and tiles (except those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets. 

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream - you can still come back here to try again.

- Change the Season to **Season of Watchers**, unless Pandemonium is not yet available on the Dreamworld, in which case change the Season to **Ordinary Days**

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers on `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 170
*It was a long journey! Finally, we arrive at the Edge of the Mud Sea, also called the Sea of Sleeping.*

*Further on is a much darker sea. Nobody has travelled there yet. Or at least has come back to talk about it. The black waves make us shiver.*

- You have fulfilled all of your Tasks. Discard the **"Let's Sail" card** - it will not be needed anymore during this Dream.

- Reshuffle **all Turn cards** and create a new Turn deck including all 12 cards. Turn cards work as in the basic rules and if you run out of them, resolve the **Out of Turns effect** from the Dream Gate tile again.

*What next? Well, decide for yourself.*


# 171
If you cannot return to the **Ladder space** (e.g. because the Dream/Slumber ends), place the Dreamers in any `start` spaces of the current Dreamscape.

*Definitely too much. But we guessed it would end this way. The mill's heart could not stand it. The machine exploded. When the smoke dissipates, all that is left is the scattered debris of the Mill. There are dead employees all around. No one is left alive.*

- Add **tile II-37 M (Shapeless)** to the Slumber deck.

*The fate of Director Pig is unknown. Perhaps he rests in the ruins of the Mill, in his beloved bathtub...*

<u>*Victory.*</u> Each Dreamer **cures 2** `damage` or **Unseals 2 cards**.

- Each Dreamer may suffer **1** `damage` to gain **2** `ether` (*only if it doesn't cause their death*).

- Gain **card G (Deliverance Wisdom card)**.

- Gain all **cards II-34 L (Deliverance deck)**.

**Hint**: If, at some point, you find that there are too many tiles in the Slumber deck, remember about Deliverance. Not all monsters are what they seem.

- Add **all Item cards** of this Dream that you did not gain to the **Item Market**.

- Restore **3 Shopping cards (II-41 C)**.

- Discard the current Dreamscape.

- Remove from the game all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks), as well as the Dream Gate tile of this Dream.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers on `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 173
*The gate is open! What hides inside?*

Do you see the `night`(**darkness**) icon at the center? It means that the whole tile (**all 4 spaces**) is `night`. If the icon were smaller and between 2 spaces, it would mean that only those 2 spaces are `night`. If it were even smaller and only in 1 space, only this space would be `night`. `water`, `swamp`, `light`, and similar icons work in the same way.

- Before you manage to take a step in, ***something emerges from the forest...*** - [resolve] -> (257).


# 174
*A ghostly woman is sweeping the stairs with a broom.*

*"I have to clean up here. Look at this place! It's crawling with vermin. Will it ever be clean again? And those little creatures. Who will feed them?"*

- Reveal **card H**.


# 175
*We glide over the roofs bathed in the light of the rising sun - its glow squeezing through the narrow gap between the clouds and the heavy smog layer. Tendrils of smoke from the chimneys drift upwards and blend with the clouds to form an ethereal forest of gray, yellow, and blue vapour suspending the city beneath a gossamer firmament. Small lanterns of different colors, together with large illuminated advertisements, create thousands of shiny glowing reflections in the window. Our vehicle flashes under the light of a calm sky, soaring above a hill bearing a multi-levelled city centre.*

*The air is getting denser. Next to us, a truck roars and spits black clouds as it flies towards the lakes on the outskirts of the city, high on the horizon. We join a two-way stream of vehicles. There are smaller tenement houses below and a long strip of railroads connecting both ends of the skyline. Finally we see the carved roof of the Cathedral.*

*It's a quarter to seven. We flip the turn signal and break away from the stream of gliding machines. We're heading down toward the Eternal City grid...*


# 176
*The fog rises from vast swamps. Higher and higher it goes, absorbing the Sea of Glass, the tower, the crows, and us. Glass waves crash furiously against the walls, flooding the floors. The sun slowly disappears and everything is submerged in impenetrable grayness. Even the voices eventually fade away, suppressed by the absence of anything.*

- Add **tile II-38 V (Rabid Tall Man)** to the Slumber deck unless it's there already.

<u>*Failure.*</u> 

- Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets. 

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream - you can still come back here to try again.

- Each Dreamer discards all gained `threat`.

- Change the Season to **Season of Plague**.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 177
*This clock seems to be having fun. The pointer speeds up, slows down, moves forward once, and then moves backward. Despite this, everyone looks at it and adjusts their watches again and again.*

- You may **Seal 2 cards** to add or discard top Turn cards - **1 Turn card** for **each 2 Sealed cards**.

- Then place a `block` token on this action.


# 178
*The merchant greets us with a broad smile.* 

*"Buy something! Buy whatever you want! Here are my goods!"*

*He lies comfortably on a pile of luxurious pillows - we notice that something is moving inside the soft heap.*

- Place all **cards C** face down near **tile Y**. ***Don't look at their front sides!***

- Those cards are **the Merchant's advertisements with their cost printed on their backs**.

- From now on, whenever a Dreamer is in a Merchant's space, they may pay the cost of a **chosen card C** (place spent `marker` on the Dream Gate tile) to flip that card and reveal its front side.


# 179
*Well, this secret tunnel seems to be... a secret tunnel!*

*It appears it wasn't so secret after all.*

You may Relocate your Dreamer to **any** space of **A3**. **Relocate** *isn't* a standard Move but something similar to teleportation - go on, ignore the Walls and place your Dreamer in any space of the Interiors.


# 180
*From the recording, we get the exact frequency and direction from which the signal comes: the binary star system of Zeta Reticuli.*

*The red-hot Decryption Machine tries to overcome the chaos barrier in the signal in order to recreate its original pattern. Wait... something is... When the first small pieces of decoded data begin to resemble something - fragments of the Fibonacci sequence or words in different languages - the antenna, in response, starts glowing again. The signal appears! The decryptor tries to translate this into words we can understand.*

*"Br... Li..." "Briiii... Liiii..." But the voice is distorted and intermittent.*

*Suddenly, sparks shoot upwards, and smoke bellows from the computer.*

- This computer is **damaged** - mark it with `threat`.


# 181
*A loose plank, a universal symbol of hidden treasure - we can't ignore it. A moment of wiggling and we rip it off. Underneath, inside the small hole, rests an old chest. Its lid is ajar, letting out tendrils of mist. When they dissipate, we notice some curious items inside!*

- Take the **5 starting Item cards**.

**You've just earned your first Items!** There are quite a few - but you'll need them all.

And if you don't remember how Items work, check the rulebook (page 15) to refresh their rules.

You have only **3 slots** for **Active Items**. Use them to place the Items you think will be the most useful in the upcoming situation. All Dreamers may use Active Items whenever they want - either to perform the item's actions/effects **or** to discard them to the **Storage** to use them as Intent to pay for something else.

The 2 *leftover items* are placed into **Storage** - they are still yours, but currently unavailable. At least until you perform a **Restore Item effect** in some way. When you **Restore 1 item** you take 1 item off the top of the Item Storage (randomly) and place it into the Active Items display. Some effects will allow you to choose which item you make active again. If you already have 3 items here, you must discard one back to the Storage.

After you pick your active Items, you can move on - *the empty chest looks rather sad now.*


# 182
*Someone hid a stick in this chest. Could there be anything less useful? But...an idea comes to mind! This stick is a close relative to the puppets, and, as the ancient adage goes - "fight fire with fire". If you hit a puppet with this stick, maybe it'll have the desired effect?*

If this is a `light` space - reveal **card D**.

If this is a `night` space - add **1 Morphing** and roll the **Luck die**:

- `luck-x` = Suffer 1 `damage`.
- `luck-blank` = Seal 2 cards.

Finally, you may **Move the Locker 2 spaces** or **Relocate the Lamp to any tile**.


# 183
*The darkness goes on forever, it seems. We start to see something but our tired eyes seem to play tricks. We are in a white room surrounded by cables. Screens and strange devices are floating around our heads. Suddenly, we hear a soft squeal and then a patter of feet.*

*"Too early! Plug them back in, it's not time yet!"*

*The drowsiness returns and with it, the darkness that seems to go on forever...*


# 184
*Another drawer intended mainly for storing garbage... But there is something here! A lighter!*

- Gain **card E**.

*The bad news is that what we hear is probably our oppressor, right behind us...*

- You may **Flip all Progress cards** to hide in the drawer at the last moment - the darkness doesn't notice you and moves on.

**Or** you may [try escaping] -> (127).


# 185
*We see a familiar creature in the red wheelhouse - the grim reaper we used to change our course in outer space. The scary figure arrived here somehow. Do we keep running into it by accident or does it follow us wherever we go?*

*The monster stands and grabs its scythe - its eyes coldly staring at us. It drags the scythe along the ground - the scraping sound is unbearable, sparks blinding us for a moment. We will end this now - or it will end us.*

- Reveal **tile Z** and **spawn Tormentor**.


# 186
*We turn around the corner of an old, crumbling house. A massive flyover hangs above us, completely covering the sky, and residential buildings climb along its pillars. The street is inconspicuous and full of rubbish. As we approach nearer we're completely surprised when it turns out we have found an entrance to an entirely hidden railway station!*

- Add **card H (Hidden Station)** to the **Fate deck** if it is still available **OR** Settle any 1 Business from any spaces.


# 187
*Here, time exists differently - it is nothing more than a pictured image of innumerable causes of everything that exists here and now. If we notice any inaccuracies, the image immediately corrects itself. "Here and now" is constantly changing, creating, again and again, the so-called past. Our memory instantly absorbs the new version, and everything becomes a coherent whole again.*

*Maybe time is an illusion; but still, everything changes all the time.*

- Reveal **tile Y (A3)** unless it's already revealed. Place all Dreamers in any spaces of that tile.

- Discard **tiles B2 and B3**.

- Each Dreamer gains **3** `ether`. 

- Add **3 Turns**.


# 188
*We feel very nervous. It's hard to see anything in the dark, and we know that everything around us is flooded with black slush. We don't even know how deep it is here. We take a short run and jump into the dark with prayers in our hearts.*

**How much `yellow` did you spend?**

- \- [**0-4**] -> (264).
- \- [**5**] -> (595).
- \- [**6 or more**] -> (807).


# 189
*We pressed them too much, we demanded too much of them. They are people, not actuators in the machine. They were not born just to produce something from morning to evening day after day - they have their own dreams and needs. And we tried to swallow up their time, so they could not explore the world, examine the nuances of existence, contemplate the sky. Where is the time to perfect passions, explore secrets, meet with other people?*

*Or even time for primitive fun, forgetting our cares and switching off our brains?*

*The strike spreads like wildfire.*

- Move `marker` to the gray space of the **Workers track**.

- If the **Union Leader** is already revealed - it's over. [Resolve] -> (594).

- If **Union Leader** is not revealed, reveal **card B** and **Spawn Union Leader (use the Masked Man)**.


# 190
*The disease turned the animal into a hideous monster - abominable on the outside, tortured on the inside. However, our compassionate touch makes all its misfortunes disappear in mere seconds. For a moment, it's the happiest dog in the whole world.*

- **Unseal 5 cards.**


# 191
*"Are you, really?" His bug-eyes narrow with suspicion.*

Do you have **Story token B (Pass)**?

- [**Yes**] -> (776).

- [**No**] -> (832).


# 192
*The creatures try to envelop us in their silky, warm threads. They want us to slow down... Sometimes, when we struggle to break free, they hurt us, but only a little, a reminder that they know better. We're almost sure that the spiders want our happiness. Maybe they just don't understand what we need?*

- If you have the ***Calmness*** card, remove **all Web tokens** from the ***Dark Borders*** tile. If there are any **Spiders** on the ***Dark Borders*** tile, you can **Relocate them to any spaces**.

- Otherwise, **Flip 1 Progress card**.


# 193
*WE DID IT! Victory! This night belongs to us!*

*We could play until the morning if it weren't for the fact that fatigue finally begins to take its toll and our eyes find themselves closing of their own accord. We will come to see our statue in the Arena some other time...*

*Fortunately when we return, nobody has stolen our prize.*

- Place **3** `ether` on the Dream Gate tile, then end your Arena cycle and [**claim your reward**] -> (287).


# 194
*It's not difficult at all. If only we could plug it into something... Maybe it matches the streetlamp? Maybe...*

- Reveal **card F**.


# 195
*We entered a place that apparently used to be beautiful and peaceful. We can make out fountains and statues that used to represent enlightened, happy people - but now a thick ash crust makes them sad. The charm of this place is long gone, sticky webs overgrowing this area just like all other places.*


# 196
*The thing about books in this world is that they are constantly changing. As soon as we turn a few pages it feels as if we're reading a completely different book - we can learn almost everything by reading it properly.*

**Choose 1:**

- \- **Unseal all cards**.
- \- You may place **any** Progress cards (from your hand, deck, Discard pile) for **free** - but the limit of active Progress cards still applies.
- \- You may **peek** at **all Influence / Item / Fate / Flaw cards** from the Secrets of this Dream.


# 197
*Another clock...*

What time does the **clock** on the **A1 tile** tell?

- [**3**] -> (226).

- [**6**] -> (576).

- [**9**] -> (97).

- [**12**] -> (334).

- [**Other**] -> (804).


# 198
*We fall into the whirlpool. We struggle for air, to break free, to regain control, but after a few minutes of this crazy dance, we are engulfed by the darkness. We are surrounded by the cold, hard walls of the well, and we slide down, heading toward the centre of the planet. Then, we plunge somewhere into the void...*

[**Resolve**] -> (677).

# 199
*This suitcase looks suspicious. It is remarkable that, long ago, there were times when no one was shaking with fear at the sight of an ordinary suitcase. What has happened to the world?*

*Maybe we'd better leave it alone?*

- If you want to [look inside after all] -> (217).


# 200
*We did it!*

*The Dream Monger was indebted to us for his rescue. For several days, grateful for saving him, he hosted us in his apartment on the 107th floor of the Electric Tower.*

*During our time with him, we learned of notable places worth visiting. He taught us how to drive something that looked like a coal-operated flying barrel - the scratch on the fender will be a souvenir from us!*

*But this was all unimportant next to what information the Dream Monger revealed to us about the people that came before us...*
 
*"You're not from here, are you? You're not the first ones who came from Beyond. There were four others - people like you. It was so long ago... I can't remember all the details. They were looking for something, something important. I heard that they never did find it though..."*

*"There was something about it in the newspapers. The articles should still be in the Great Library. I know that they did achieve one great thing though - they uncovered their lost memories," the Dream Monger sighed in wonder. 

"Until you learn to see more, you are unlikely to succeed in this endeavour though. But let me tell you about the Basements in Pandemonium instead..."*

<u>Victory.</u> *Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`. Each Dreamer cures **2** `damage` or **Unseals 2 cards**.

- Add **tile II-37 E (Dream Monger)** to the Slumber deck. ***Remember that all newly gained slumber cards will be placed at the bottom of your existing deck.***

- Gain **tile W (Pandemonium Dreamworld Map tile)**.

- Gain **tile II-39 M ("Basements are calling" Dream Gate tile).**

*"You have to cooperate and work together if you're going to survive - this world doesn't like you yet and you all stick out like polka dots on a zebra no matter where you go."*

- Gain **card K (Help Wisdom card).**

*He kept talking but darker thoughts distracted us. A strange shadow of a man was lurking out of the corner of our eyes - following us ever since we left the market.*

- Add **tile II-37 F (Nightmare Janitor)** to the Slumber deck.

- Add **card J (Shrinking Items)** to the Flaws deck.

- Add all Item cards of this Dream that you did not gain to the Item Market.

- Restore 3 Shopping cards **(II-41 C)**.

- Change the Season to **Ordinary Days**.

- Discard the current Dreamscape map.

- Remove from the game all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks), as well as the Dream Gate tile of this Dream.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers on `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.

# 201
*When work seems to drag on forever, everyone dreams of a magic button which speeds the time to lunch break or to the end of the work day.* 

*In fact, such a button exists here. If you press it, time speeds forwards. It hurts like crazy, but well, sometimes it's worth the pain.*

=>Each Dreamer may suffer 1 `damage`. If you decide to do this, discard the top **Turn card**.

# 202
*"Oh, yes, the truth. There's real power in that. We shall accept that offering."*

Discard your active Mask to ***Remind*** once, then Move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

**OR**

Return your Mask (active or not) to the Mask pool (returning its corresponding Mask card to the Secrets) to ***Remind*** all cards, then Move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

# 203
*No one ever fixes this hole in the bridge. Because no one ever fixes it, the hole just keeps getting bigger and bigger... We must jump over it.*

How much of a running start will you take?

[***-A small running start***] -> (484).

[***-A large running start*** - discard 2 `gem` and resolve] -> (975)

***-I don't want to jump yet*** - end resolving this script.

# 204
*We hear the clattering of dishes.*

*"Since I'm here all alone with nothing else to do, maybe I'll cook dinner. You know, the fancy one - Boeuf Bourguignon. It was always their favorite. Just in case they come today. They'll love it. I'm sure of it. Now I'll just wait for them to come..."*

- You may **Seal 3 cards** to cure **1** `damage`.

# 205
*That was really stupid. The ship flipped and now the whole deck is covered in mud.*

- Place **1 Mud** in each upper space of **tile B1** and **tile B2**.

Don't discard the **current Turn card**.

# 206
*We wipe the sweat from our foreheads and sneak a peek at the viewership numbers. There are less than a hundred people watching us. Don't they have anything better to waste their time on?*

- Each Dreamer may **Seal 1 card** to cure 1 `damage`.

- Resolve the top card from the **Arena Fate deck** (remember to add 1 Dreamscape Slumber Map tile!).

- Resolve the top Slumber tile from the **Arena Slumber deck** and add **2 Morphings** during its setup.

If you end this Slumber with a <u>Victory</u>:

- Each Dreamer gains 1 `gem`.
- Move the `marker` on the Dream Gate tile to the next slot, following the arrows.
- Resolve the script displayed in the slot you just reached.

Otherwise, end your Arena cycle and resolve Awakening.

# 207
*We have to stop whining and do something with our lives! But if it was that easy, no one would ever feel like us.*

*When we look around, a feeling of melancholy washes over us like a tide...*

*But wait... There's no one here. Was it all a memory of our previous lives?*

=>If there is at least **1 Web** on the ***Rift*** tile:

*Oh no. The melancholy has returned. Anything we do is pointless*. - You may return all cards used to perform this action to your hand.

=>If there are **NO Web tokens** on the ***Rift*** tile, gain **card G**.

# 208
*In such a place, where everyone looks down at their feet or gazes into glowing screens nestled between their hands, it is difficult to force yourself to look beyond the end of your nose.* 

*Interesting... There is something there. We see a light...*

=>Reveal **tile Y**, if it is available.

*How could we get there?*

# 209
*The device bubbles and coloured liquids overflow in glass containers.* 

*It looks like we can fill a container with one of the liquids - it could come in handy later...*

=>Gain 1 random **card II-34 T (Toxins)**.

*Here beats the true heart of the Underground. From here, we would be able to make it back to the surface quickly. Everything seems so simple, yet still infinitely extensive and constantly changing.*

*We see tracks leading to the great train station and a pipeline heading to the port. It would do us good to learn how to navigate the rail system in this foreign world.*

*But then again, wasn't it at the port that we were supposed to pick up our package? The one mysteriously sent before we even began our journey?*

*The underground can take you anywhere you want, if you know how to navigate it.*

*The Dream Monger was right - the longer we stay here, the more we truly understand it, including the things we would rather not.*

*But this is the only way we can regain our knowledge - to learn our purpose here. The answers are out there, we just need to find them!*

<u>Victory</u>:

- Each Dreamer gains 1 `ether`.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.
*But this Heart of the Underground will always be here waiting for us.*

# 210
*We see the remains of two stone columns. In times long forgotten, initiates would walk between them to enter the world of knowledge.*

*We notice the broken threads of history, of civilisations repeating their cycles of ascension and decline.*

*Some paths, that have gone unnoticed by time, lead to extraordinary worlds of which we have only dreamed.*

*We have to reveal our real faces to move on.*

=>You may discard your Mask to reveal **tile X** or to Unseal all cards.

=>If no Dreamer has any active Masks, reveal **tile X**.

# 212
*Let's look at this dream...*

*We're in the air high above, piloting an old biplane.*

*The sky is cloudy and all indications are pointing to a hell of a storm about to break.*

*On board, passengers packed like sardines are looking for any sign of light, for even the slightest rift in the dark veil.*

*Things are looking grim when the engines begin to fail but the plane, instead of falling, begins to rise higher and higher...*

*Rating: Well, it looks quite interesting.*

Place 1 Story token on the Dream Gate tile.

If the pack didn't consist of only `yellow`, resolve [] -> (135)


# 213
*A shot in the dark, wasn't it?*

=>Each Dream suffers 1 `damage`. Then discard 1 Turn card.


# 214
*It looks like a simple lift. Inside, you notice that there is writing on it: "Max: 6 people. Load capacity: 600 kgs."*

*Nearby, you notice a small inscription: "It won't move unless you truly* ***know yourself."***

*Well, we're not sure exactly who we are but we're starting to remember some things, right? Maybe what we know is enough.*

*However, apparently it isn't. You try everything you can think of to coax it into moving, but it's all for naught. The lift is mercilessly stone-faced and doesn't budge.*


# 215
*Pah! I almost drowned. It's definitely not suitable for eating!*

=>Relocate **2 spaces down and 1 space left**.

=>Gain 1 `gem`.


# 216
*Maybe we'll do better next time.*

<u>Failure.</u>

=> Discard the current Dreamscape.

=> Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets.

=> Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream - you can still come back here to try again.

=> Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers on `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 217
*Okay. Click.*

=> Discard the top card of your Influence deck. If the **colour** of Intent of the card is:

- `yellow` - *There is a tiny swipe card inside. It seems to be an electronic key.* Gain **1 key**.

- `red` - *Oops, it blows up!* Suffer 1 `damage`.

- `green` - *The suitcase is practically empty but you can feel something inside. Sometimes that is imperceptible at first glance is especially precious.* Gain 1 `ether`.

If this card has several colours, pick any one of them.

=> Then, gain 1 additional Baggage and place a `block` token on this action.


# 218
[*Is it an envelope?*] -> (790).

*Is it a Rulebook or a Script Book? A box? Something else?* - *"It just tastes bad. No, thanks."*


# 219
*It's not a secret that all sea creatures are wiser than us.*

*Their history began millions of years before ours, and they will still exist when we are long buried.*

*And this particular creature standing before us - half-human, half-fish with opposable thumbs and ocean's knowledge - must be the wisest of them all.*

*A smiling mermaid looks at us with cold eyes.*

Which one thing would you like to ask the mermaid about?

- [**The observatory**] -> (002).
- [**The mysterious island**] -> (742).
- [**The Great Sea**] -> (153).
- [**Treasures**] -> (939).

# 220
***Ships's log 11.***

*There is only emptiness ahead of me. Behind me, there is only the great unknown - even larger and more formidable than the emptiness that lies ahead.*

*Home - my only hope. I should have turned back and died with the others. Existing in loneliness in this accursed void is not living at all.*

*I have to get back home, no matter what it costs me. This is the only place where I can truly live.*

*Is there any hope left? Is there anything else left?*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`.

- Cross out the number on the **"Reading the Ship's log"** and write a new one: **"735"**.


# 221
*We don't have time to rummage through the trash! We've got to run or hide! The darkness may devour us at any moment!*

=>Add 1 **Morphing** and draw **2 influence cards**.


# 222
*If we don't do anything, our newfound courage will fade away like the setting sun!*

*We will not be discouraged by the dark, alluring chasm or the wreck of the car! The howling wind won't change our minds! The taste of ash will not spoil our determination. Or will they...?*

=>If you have the ***Motivated*** card, perform (for free) **1 Map Action** from any visible space *without Web*, except "Take an Action."

=>Otherwise, you are **Paralyzed**.


# 223
*Something very interesting lies at the bottom of the crate. It's definitely too large to fit in there but somehow it's there. We have a strong feeling that this one is meant to travel with us.*

=>You may discard 3 `gem` or return the **Real Treasure** card to the Secrets to gain 1 new random Item from the Item Market.

*We hear a stern voice: "Who goes there? Stop! Show your papers!"*

=>Relocate the **Warden** to this space. Add **1 Morphing**.


# 224
*The lift starts begrudgingly. It screeches awfully, shoots sparks around and wobbles as if it could fall at any moment. Somehow, it miraculously maintains its upward trajectory and slowly ascends.*

*We observe the lights of each passing floor until a ray of sunshine finally sneaks through the slit in the door.*

*We're back in the forest again. Trees sway with the wind, struggling to escape the forest they are in. It is cold and the sun has long since retired for the day.*

*The birds have stopped singing and somewhere in the distance, beyond the hills hidden by the forest, we can see some lights and the glow of a city. We can smell the smoke billowing from the chimneys.*

**Does it feel as if someone is leading you on a string? Someone or something?**

- Reveal **tile W**.

- Relocate all Dreamers to `start` spaces on **A1**.

It seems as if you've made it farther into the dark rift!

What might you find inside?

Hopefully you've escaped the creature once and for all.

- Reveal **card B**.

- It's an **Overlay** card. To place it correctly, [read this] -> (016).


# 225
*"It's been three years. Three long years of war. We must win, for the stakes are much too high."*

*"Our enemies are not humans at all. They are primitive roaches stripped of all semblance of humanity. They eat children and pray to the devil. Their language is incoherent babble and their clothes are grotesque. Their very existence is an insult to the world. We have to crush them; tear them apart; annihilate all of them without mercy. Otherwise, this war will never end. We're here to protect peace in the world, we will not settle for anything else! At dawn, we will launch our assault and capture the enemy's position."*

=>Each Dreamer on **B4** gains 1 `gem`.

=>Add **1 Morphing**.

# 228
*After a few hours of wandering we've have had enough. We're ready to go anywhere just as long as we get out of this place... That's how we found ourselves here in this shady neighborhood. A tightly tied-up teddy bear hangs by the neck from nearby scaffolding - we don't want to be in its place.*

# 229

*Unfortunately, we don't see a single way to enter the building; not a single window or door anywhere.*

=>Reveal **tile X**.

# 230

***Ship's log 04.*** 

*The lights which had been hounding me finally changed course and retreated, leaving me alone in the darkness. I was sure it was all over for me but I survived somehow.*

*I look at the screens showing the ever-shrinking planet Earth. Even from here, I can still see raging fires and intermittent peppering of city-sized explosions.*

*I force myself to block it out of my mind. My home, my loved ones, Alice, everything - all have been left behind. Eventually Earth became a tiny dot and then faded into the darkness of space. Now there was only silence and an ever-growing emptiness.*

*Even though my body feels fatigued, exhausted by fear and worry and my mind races through a thousand and one hopeless scenarios, my training takes control. Instinct, waning adrenaline and muscle memory guiding the ship away from this mysterious war that had somehow ravaged Earth.*

*One thing is certain - at least for now, I've managed to escape. I'm still alive and that's enough.*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`.

- Gain **1 Hour**

- Cross out the number on the **"Reading the Ship's log"** and write a new one: **"910"**.

# 233
*We sneak behind the curtain. The fabric flutters aside as we move past it. We push away another curtain, and another, walking through a flowing satin corridor. There is a door at the end.*

You may **Flip 1 Progress card** to **Relocate to any space**.

# 234
If you're here, it means that you tried to use the **Assault action** - this usually represents a physical, often violent solution to a problem. Remember that the **Assault action** can be used from a distance. The basic range of this action is 1 (also stated on your Basic Actions card for quick reference) but many cards may increase it. Similarly the **Contact action**, representing diplomacy and friendlier interactions, is the same. 

Do not forget the effect of your action: place 1 `marker` on the **Dream Gate tile card** (the large square card with **"Gate to the First Dream"** on it).

Also, do not forget to Block this action with a `block` token as well since there is a `block` icon. This means that this action cannot be used again!


# 235
*We dive and find an underground rivulet.*

=>Relocate to any `water` space.

=>Draw **1 influence card**.


# 236
If all Dreamers are on [**A2**, go to] -> (763)

Otherwise, Relocate the **Scarecrow** to this space.

# 237
- [It's a **Flaw card**!] -> (997)

- [Or a **Note card**?] -> (167)

- [Or a **Lucid Influence card**?] -> (034)

- [Or a **Thorn Knight card**?] -> (289)

- [Or a **Silver Key card**?] -> (666)

- [Or a **Deliverance card**?] -> (593)

- [Or **something else**???] -> (440)

# 238
=>Reshuffle the 12 **Turn cards** and make a new Turn deck out of them.

[If **tile W** is not revealed, go to] -> (632).

# 239
*We check the sample under a microscope. The analytical devices run sequentially and data appears on the screen. Oh that means we are dealing with...*

You may discard **1 Story token** to discard all **Morphings** and each Dreamer gains 1 `ether`.

# 240
*Well, I'm pushing my luck...*

*When my legs are inside, I feel as my feet submerge in something cold and sticky. Shivers run down my spine. Nope, not this time!*

*I practically jump out of the hole and frantically look around. The darkness is even more terrifying. Shadows dance around us as if they were mocking us.*

=>Place 3 `threat` in any spaces (max. 1 `threat` per space).

# 241
*The hand of this poor soul seems like the most filthy thing in the whole world. Even if we don't catch some disease, our disgust would convince us we had. Ugh!*

You may gain **1 Flaw** to gain all available `gem`.

# 242
*Nothing drives progress like conflicts and clashes. At least, that's what the Endless City authorities believe. Therefore, from time to time, bloody competitions are organized in special arenas. Everything is broadcast live throughout the city, and this is when the most expensive ads are shown. Everyone can take part in the struggle to prove their true worth to themselves and to others.*

*The prizes are great, but only for those who score high enough.*

*Finally, we've made it here.*

Place a `marker` in the **START** slot of the Dream Gate tile.

Resolve the **top Slumber tile** from the **Arena Slumber Deck**.

*Note*: When playing Slumbers in the Arena, resolve the Victory/Out of Turns/Skip effects as usual. You may use Hours, Items, etc. Resolved Slumber tiles are placed at the bottom of the Arena Slumber deck. You may play in the Arena with any number of Dreamers, but you cannot change until the current Arena cycle is complete. If you don't manage to achieve Victory in a Slumber, your Arena cycle ends immediately, and you leave the Arena without a reward.

Let's get started!

If you end this Slumber with a <u>Victory</u>:

- Each Dreamer gains 1 `gem`.

- Move the `marker` on the Dream Gate tile to the next slot, following the arrows

- Resolve the script displayed in the slot you just reached.

Otherwise, end your Arena cycle and resolve Awakening.



# 243
If the current Turn Suit is ***NOT*** `hearts`, you use the steering wheel to navigate the meandering corridors.

If the current Turn Suit ***is*** `hearts`:

*Suddenly a crewmember appears next to you and falls into the swamp. Will you save him?*

- [Tack?] -> (416)

- [Jibe?] -> (568)

- [Don't do a thing] -> (744).

- [Pay 1 `red` to throw him a lifebuoy] -> (585)

- [Pay 1 `red` to use a life raft] -> (660)

# 244
*That bird, that inscription... Wait a moment...*

=>Gain **Story token A**.

=>If you don't find any use for this token until the end of this Dream, discard it.

# 245
*Nearby, in the middle of a swamp, we see an island. It will be difficult to get there since it's surrounded by wetlands and quagmires. On the shores, there is a vast mound of mud, piled as if something massive had crawled out of it.*

*We reach for the ubiquitous mud. What is this all about? Hmm....maybe there is something to it...*

Gain 1 `gem`.

# 246
*Time is an illusion. Although it can be painful, it can't hurt us in this place. We could live on in here forever. But we won't since it's not time for that just yet.*

Take the **12 Turn cards** and shuffle them to make a new Turn deck.

# 247
*What is this poor mutt doing here all alone on the tracks? We take the mangy dog in our arms. As if sensing our good intentions, it waits there calmly. When we walk back to the platform, the dog says goodbye with a single bark and a wag of its tail before heading off.*

*Something else besides the dog has also disappeared... it has devoured one of my bags! I probably lost some items in it but at least it's much easier to travel now.*

=>Discard **1 Baggage**.

# 248
Below interactions, there are 3 **Entity effects** that this Entity performs in the Dreamscape Phase: **Morphing**, **Basic**, and **Special**, in addition to its **Movement**.

![Morphing](/assets/images/secrets/morphing.png "Morphing")

![Basic](/assets/images/secrets/basic.png "Basic")

![Special](/assets/images/secrets/special.png "Special")

As you can see, they correspond to Steps on the **Turn cards**.

When Dreamers finish their actions in each **Turn**, the **Dreamscape Phase** takes effect. You do this by resolving the current **Turn card** (the face up card on the top of your Turn deck). Resolve all Steps from the current Turn card in order. Steps may trigger some of the Entity's effects. For example, the first Turn may be: **Movement**> **Special effect**> **Morphing effect**, and the second one may be: **Basic effect**> **Basic effect** again> **Movement**. Each Turn is different from the others.

This Entity has no **Morphing** effects available (as it would make it too powerful for you now otherwise). If a specific Entity doesn't have some of the effects, treat them as if they do *nothing* when they should be resolved. **Morphings** are basically ***power ups*** that make Entities a lot meaner and more difficult to deal with. When an effect tells you to "**add 1 (or more) morphings**" you will draw randomly from the Morphing Token pile and place them face up on the Entity. From then on, as long as the Entity has the token, it will apply its effects. See [**ENTITY: MORPHINGS**] -> (248.1) for more information.

The **Basic effect** is the effect that is triggered the most often. The Basic effect will generally harm nearby Dreamers. In this case, if any Dreamer is in **range 1** (*in the same or in an adjacent space*) when resolving the **Basic effect** of this Entity, this Dreamer suffers **1** `damage`. If you don't remember how `damage` works, [consult: **Dying**] -> (450.2). In short - if any Dreamer suffers their **8th** `damage`, they die. And usually this isn't pleasant.

The **Special effect** of this Entity has an even *greater range* of **2**. Remember that range may be counted in any direction **orthogonally** (up, down, left, right), but **not diagonally**. A space connected diagonally is in range **2** - 1 space vertically and 1 horizontally. In this case, the Special effect **Seals 2 cards**. [For a reminder of how sealing works go to ] -> (450.2). 

It's a good habit to always look at the **Turn card** and check what the Entity will do when you end your **Dreamers Phase**. If it doesn't look good, keep a safe distance or attack to temporarily repel the monster.

Sometimes your Dreamers will have other tricks up their sleeves in order to manipulate this card. For example, one of your influence cards (**"Thoughtful Moment"**) allows you to ***"Seal it in order to block any 1 Step on the current Turn card"***. When you do this you can use a `marker` to "block" a certain effect from happening. This can sometimes get you out of tight spots!

![Thoughtful](/assets/images/secrets/thoughtful.jpg "Thoughtful Moment")

You've opened a door and revealed 2 tiles - and so many things have changed! And that's not all, because you might have overlooked something - [see] -> (251).


# 249
*Finally, the scenes are arranged correctly. Here is that magical moment when we first met on a busy street a long time ago. Right beside an unwanted, repressed memory that I don't even want to look at.*

*And, in the end, which memory is more important? Well, maybe they're all equally important. Each of them created and shaped us. There's no need to return to them right now, but its comforting to know that all will remain forever in our silver box.*

<u>Victory</U>:

- Gain **card F (The 5th Silver Key)**.

- Take and look at **card D (House of cards Wisdom card)**. You may gain it, but then any 1 Dreamer has to return 1 random Influence card to the Influence Market. If no Dreamer decides to do this, remove this Wisdom card from the game.

- Each Dreamer gains 1 `ether`.

- Each Dreamer cures 1 `damage` or Unseals 1 card.

- Restore 3 **Shopping cards (II-41 C)**.

- Discard the current Dreamscape.

- Add all Influence cards of this Dream that you did not gain to the Influence Market.

- Remove from the game all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks), as well as the Dream Gate tile of this Dream.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.

# 250
*Even if you installed a hundred fans in here, it would still be stuffy. Besides, this one doesn't even work. Hey! There's a passage behind it. I wonder where it goes...*

Relocate to any space with a **Hatch**.

# 251
Did you notice that when the gate opened, you unearthed a new space with 2 **new Map Actions**? Difficult choices await you now, right? To enter and check if there's something that can help you or go back, see around the Wall and check the new space outside the grotto. But what about the dangers that lurk behind you?

It's still early in the game, so your options will be presented here as a little divagation:

**Option A**) Run into the grotto and perform the action at the end of it - **Close the Door**. It looks quite sturdy and should save you from the beast. But will you make it? The action is *really expensive*: **10** `green`. The designers have to be *mad*, right? If you had **2-3 turns** or you had the right cards and lady luck on your side, you would manage to do it, but the creature would probably also be inside - shutting yourself in with it isn't the brightest idea.

**Option B**) There is a similar action on the outside - and it's cheaper! **1** `green` is almost nothing. But if you close the door from the outside, how would you get inside? Maybe through the nearby secret tunnel?

*"The situation is exaggerated and stupid and obvious,"* you might think. Maybe you're right, but don't you think the first Dream shouldn't be too complicated?

Maybe there are other options? But do what you want! The door won't close by itself.

# 252
*It seems to me that nobody has ever looked in this box...*

=>Look at the Pool of Items **(cards B)** and gain 1 of them. Then place a `block` token on this Map Action.

*As we rummage through the box, we feel a presence behind us.*

=>If this is a `night` space, place 1 `threat` in this space (max. 1 `threat` per space).

*When we close the box, we see a human shape under the pile of dirty rags.*

=>***"Help me... I beg you...,"*** *the shape whispers.* ***Pull me out..."***

*We inspect the pile of rags and spot an emaciated, filthy person trapped underneath. It doesn't look safe.*

Do you want to release this creature? [If you want to risk it] -> (591).

# 253
*Everything must have a bottom. It's just that we can't see it here. We drop a stone which bounces around for a very long time before it finally stops some distance below. Wow, that's really deep.*

*Suddenly, a red light emerges from somewhere below. The light spreads out, enveloping the room as if it was scanning us.*

=>Each Dreamer may spend 2 `red` to gain 2 `gem`.

=>Additionally, you may **remove** your Mask (*place it back to the Mask pool not belonging to any Dreamer*), and then gain 3 random cards from the Influence Market. Make your choice carefully!

# 254
*The stone bridge is solid and leads to the lighthouse. However our sixth sense tells us that there's something hiding beneath the bridge. Probably clinging to its underside, waiting patiently for careless wanderers hoping to cross. Looking more closely, we see tiny tentacles skimming the surface of the water.*

=>Look carefully at the bridge spaces. As you are able to see on the card, 3 spaces are changed into a solid land mass, thus connecting the island and the lighthouse.

# 255
*This mud is starting to come in handy...*

Relocate **3 spaces to the left.**

# 256
*The farther we slide towards the angry clouds, the more treasure we find. They float without any cares in the world, cherishing their time. They don't fear the flashing lightning bolts. We should however as the lightning vaporises the water as it strikes inches closer to us.*

Roll the **Luck die**:

- `luck-x` = Suffer 1 `damage`.

- `luck-blank` = Seal 3 cards.

- `luck-1`/`luck-2` = Restore 1 item.

- `luck-3` = Gain 1 `ether`.

# 257
Reveal **tile Y** and **Spawn 1 Human Shapeshifter**. Spawning means to place 1 miniature in a `spawn` (**Entity Spawn**) space. There is only 1 `spawn` space in the current Dreamscape so this is easy.

There is no flavour text this time - treat this script as an active pause, an opportunity to learn more about your enemy.

**Tile Y** is an Entity tile - place it on the Entity slot. Entities represent the creatures found within the Dreamworld - they are the boogeymen and fairies; some are hostile while others are helpful. All entities act during the **DREAMSCAPE PHASE** which occurs after Dreamers have performed all their actions and passed. What they do is determined by the **CURRENT TURN CARD**.

![Something wicked](/assets/images/secrets/something-wicked.jpg "Something wicked")

Notice how **Something Wicked** has a Movement value of 4. This is important when you resolve the **Movement step** (a yellow die icon on the current Turn card) and roll the **Entity Movement die**. If the result is `move-1`, the Entity moves by **1 space**, ***ignoring*** its Movement value. If the result is `move-full`, it moves by its **full** Movement value - in this case, by **4 spaces**. If the result is `move-full+`, it moves by its **full Movement value** ***and*** you roll the Movement die **again** and it moves **again**. 

![Movement die](/assets/images/secrets/movement-die.png "Movement die")

Entities **always** move towards the **nearest** Dreamer unless stated otherwise. If there are several Dreamers in the same range, you may decide which one is targeted by the Entity. This comes in handy if you need to divert the Entity from a wounded companion, lure the Entity to a specific space, or perform other tricks.

What happens if there is no valid route toward any Dreamer or if the Entity already is in a space with a Dreamer? It simply ***won't move***.

Below the name of the Entity you'll find **Entity Interactions** - there is only one this time, and it is the **Assault action** (**6** `red` `player-x`).

If you spend a total of 6 `red` multiplied by the number of Dreamers, you activate the Assault effect. In this case, you Relocate the Entity to any `spawn` space. Remember that **Relocate** is a more beneficial Movement because it *ignores* **Walls**. Think of Relocating as the ability to *teleport*. For now, Relocating to any `spawn` space won't help you much because there is currently only **1** `spawn` space in the Dreamscape. So, each time you perform the Assault interaction, you "teleport" this Entity back to its `spawn` space.

[There's more - see] -> (248).


# 258
*Why did we go after this accursed treasure? As soon as we opened the lid, we hear a tremendous footfall. The walls tremble with each terrifying step. With each footfall, the mud rises and floods everything. Is this the end?*

=>Reveal **tile Z** and Spawn the **Swamp Walker**.

=>Place a `block` token on the `green` action on the **Treasure Chest card**.

=>If each Dreamer **Seals 3 cards**, `block` 1 chosen Step on the **current Turn card**.

*Can we escape this monster somehow?*


# 259
*There was an inscription, but someone mixed up the letters!*

Guess the **3-digit code** and resolve the corresponding script. All clues you need are on this card.

Choose wisely, because there is a **penalty** for those who make mistakes.

If you need hints, **each** Dreamer may suffer 1 `damage` or **Seal 1 card** to read one of the following:

- [First hint] -> (682).

- [Second hint] -> (934).

# 260
*It is difficult to say whether this is actually an old mine or a big shopping mall buried under the ground with its top floor protruding above layers of dust. We see a plethora of posters, maps, and diagrams hanging on the walls. Although their colors have faded away and many of them are peeling off, we can still read some of them. It's good to know at least a little bit of what we're dealing with.*

=> Reveal **tile V (Scavenger)** unless it's already revealed.

=> You may suffer 1 `damage` or discard 2 `gem` to discard **1 Morphing** from *any* Entity.

# 261
***Ship's log 06.*** 

*The Moon is far behind me. The days go on like weeks. The weeks go on like years. There is nobody. I'm alone. Every morning, day, evening, night, whatever that means anymore. Always alone. The days are measured by counters and I'm running out. Through the windows, all I see is unending darkness and stars. Nothing changes. Day by day, I float through the black void with the engines off.*

*I remember all those ordinary days on Earth. Every day, every single inconspicuous moment. Every previously underestimated moment.*

*I dream of Alice and of all those ordinary days I took for granted. Their true value now revealed to me too late...*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.

- Cross out the number on the **"Reading the Ship's log"** and write a new one: **"556"**.

# 262
*We need to restart the power supply. We pull the lever. Lights blink and slowly bring the room to life. The buzzing in the room intensifies as sparks start to rain down. All the lights turn on, one by one. We have full power again.*

=>Flip **tile X** face up.

=>Reveal **card A (Power)** and place 1 `marker` on it.

At the beginning of each Turn, each working Generator gives you **1 Power** (place 1 `marker` on the Power card).

From now on, you may use all Equipment with a **Power cost icon** (a number in a gray circle). To use Equipment, you must complete all of the following:

- Be in its space
- Spend the amount of **Power** given in the **Power cost icon** of the Equipment (by discarding that many `marker` from the Power card)
- **Add 20** to the number of the given script and resolve the ***check*** action.

Remember that you cannot use Equipment if it *doesn't* have any **Power cost**!

However, you may still check Equipment instead of using it since they are two separate actions with different outcomes.

# 263
*Oh no... It's Bully!*

*"Hey where do you think you're goin'? What do you have in that bag? Show me! Give me that, or else...!"*

Flip 1 Progress card or Seal 1 card.

# 264
*We jump, but it was not far enough...*

Resolve ***Cold Bath***.

*Was it a mistake, though? Sometimes you have to take a step back in order to take two steps forward. When we fall, we see something nearby.*

Reveal **card E**.

# 265
*Let's look at this dream...*

*We look at an old painting hanging in a dark, cobwebbed corridor. It's a picture of an awe-inspiring, almost inhuman saint. We see that it has been repainted hundreds of times. The subsequent layers of paint changed it into a thick, flaky relief. Who or what was this person? Would the very first and oldest layer tell us the truth? We begin to rip off the paint, revealing the hidden truth...*

*Rating: Enough. It's weak, very weak. Maybe we will be able to sell it at the afternoon market?*

=>Gain 2 `gem`.

# 266
*The old man whispers, "Finally you start to see..."*

=>Reveal **card C**.

# 267
*This table is just the right size to play something on. But not in this dirt...*

*Oh, and right here something glitters nicely in the dark!*

=>Gain 1 `gem`.

*We take another step and - **OUCH!** Some glass shards...*

=>If this is a `night` space, spend 2 `red` or suffer 1 `damage`.

*"Don't forget that each of us has a hidden,* ***inner light***," *a strange thought appears in our minds.*

# 268
*As we turn the blue key to close the door, we notice tiny blue flakes peeling off the key. After a while, we scrape it off and discover a shiny silver key underneath.*

- Remove the **"Blue Key" Blank token** from the game.

- Find the **6th Silver Key card (I-18 D)** in the removed game elements and gain it.

# 269
*There is nothing here, except for old machinery. We should move on. We plan each step meticulously as we wade in the thick, green sludge. It's better not to trip on something, as we fear what could await us in the murky, stale water.*

If there's `threat` in range 1, **Seal 1 card**.

Relocate to any `start` space. You may reveal any **1 unrevealed Map tile** in the **same row or column** and place your Dreamer in `start` space of that tile.

# 270
*A big hole caught our attention. We smell the odour of the den from the pit.*

If the **Scarecrow** is on the Dreamscape, you may Relocate it to your space to gain **card F**.

# 271
*What is this book about? It looks like it has a little bit of everything, as it happens in the world of dreams. We review the table of contents. It is constantly changing, but after a few moments of focus, we extract several chapters from it.*

**Choose 1 chapter**:

- [***"Be a better you. On self-improvement by the 'not so smart' method."***] -> (925).

- [***"A selection of the best jokes from a hundred years ago. Check if they're still funny."***] -> (227).

- [***"Green in the soul, or escape to nature."***] -> (663).

# 272
*The observatory is open to us. We spend a lot of time here tinkering with its state-of-the-art equipment. While gazing at the mesh of canals on Mars we see a powerful electric discharge originating from Jupiter blasting the red planet and leaving a vast, gaping scar behind.*

*Next we point the telescope to the Moon. We see crystal spheres protruding from the gray moon dust and an enormous mechanical arm clamping the poles in such a way that we never see its mysterious dark side.* 

*We observe an asteroid belt full of the remains of ancient machines and cosmic junk, much of which we can't even begin to fathom their original intended purpose. Strange creatures zoom around the orbits of planets like drafting race car drivers and the occasional rare spacecraft crosses the void from time to time.*

*We also notice a single constellation.*

=>Reveal **card H (Ursa Minor)**.

# 273
*No, we're not angels - we don't even compare to these awe-inspiring creatures. But we were able to help someone again. When we hear a plea for help, we back away. You don't have to be an angel to help someone, right? Even if it's not easy, even if it's inconvenient and time-consuming.*

=>If the **Protege** is in this space, you may discard 1 `gem` to discard 1 `damage` from the **Dream Gate tile**.

*"What time is it? Oh, it's getting late. That's not good. I have to go. Thanks for this meeting. I'll see you next time. Bye!"*

# 274
*When we pay attention to this doll, she awakens and in a barely audible voice, starts whispering...*

*I think she wants to help us. But how much can such a small thing help us with anything? Her soft voice raises slightly higher.*

*She must be angry. We might have judged her too quickly.*

**Choose 1**:

- Discard **all Morphings**.

- Block **1 Step** from the **current Turn card**.

- **Paralyze** 1 Entity in the Dreamscape.

![Paralyze](/assets/images/secrets/paralyze.png "Paralyze")


# 275
*I have something... Something is here. Yes! This is what I was looking for!*

=> Reveal **card D**.

=> Relocate **2 spaces down and 2 spaces to the left**.

# 276
*We're not quite sure what that was thing was. It could have been a ghastly hand or a snake. It happened so quickly.*

*This... monstrosity pulled us into the drawer. The drawer is cramped and filled with liquid darkness and foetid horrors. We struggle to break free but something grips us tightly.*

**Seal 3 cards** or gain **1 Flaw**.

*Finally, we flail around so hard that the drawer opens a little and we make a break for it. The drawer shuts behind us with a mighty crash*.

# 277
*The green, ivy-entwined temple rises above the roofs of nearby buildings. The green ghostly glow of several floodlights concentrates high above its vaulted roof illuminating a giant statue of a repulsive winged creature with tentacles growing out of its face.*

*The rays of light are ever constantly flickering giving the impression that the monster is alive and moving in slow motion.*

*We bow to the statue like so many others before us. After all, people go here to worship every day for a reason. There must be something to it.*

- Each Dreamer may find and *remove* 1 of their **Flaw cards**.

# 278
*We're sure our *protege* hid something in here. We have to search this place. Yup, there is something in here!*

*And nothing terrible happened. We are in the next room. It's kind of familiar. Wait, this is...*

=>Place your Dreamer in the Exit space of **A1**.

# 280
*The computers are strange. Thick glass screens are embedded in decorative wooden frames. Instead of keyboards, there are just big metal knobs. These things look more like equipment from an old radio station than modern day computers. However they work just fine and that's enough.*

=>Reveal **card D (Top Secret Research)** if it's not revealed and is still available.

# 281
*We see stone remains and tombs floating in the void. Pale people crawl out of them. The colour of their skins and clothes bloom and their bodies grow younger and smaller until eventually, they disappear as a single cell of life. Each of them lives for a brief moment, like elusive smoke, coming into existence only to dissolve moments later.*

*Everything that they create also disappears after a while - sometimes remaining for a little longer, sometimes disappearing right away.*

*But all of this is only the superficial layer of meaning; an inner truth lurks deeper beneath. A truth which is hidden somewhere behind the gate.*

=>You may discard 1 `gem` to **Unseal all cards**.

=>Then, if you have a Blank token with a ["Newcomer" inscription] -> (341).

# 282
*The beast lays motionless but not dead. We can see her steady breathing. Let's try to wake her up, lure her into the trap, and then destroy her.*

*She has broken out of this trap once before so we'll need to be careful.*

*Four giant chains at the top of the platform are shattered, but maybe we can somehow bind her again when she is in the right position.*

=>Reveal **tile V (Scavenger)** unless it's already revealed.

=>Spawn `player` Scavengers.

If **tile Y (Belshazar)** is not revealed yet, roll the Luck die:

=>`luck-2`/`luck-3` = You did it! [Resolve] -> (588).

=>If you are not successful, it would be wise to gather more `gem` before the next attempt. Look at the Scavenger Entity tile. These creatures like trinkets and have many with them.

*Do we have time for this? We can take a chance and use a more direct method - although it can be very dangerous...*

=>If you still haven't managed to wake up the beast, each Dreamer may Seal 8 cards to [wake her up this way] -> (588). 

# 283
*First was the City. Eternal, ruthless, omnipresent. It seduces us all and turns us into mindless monsters. We flow through its corridors and streets like sewage, carrying an unbearable stench with us. We infest our surroundings and ourselves. Neon lights blind vicious minds that walk in milky darkness.*

*But it's also a colourful, complicated world full of wonder. It all depends on what you want to see.*

# 284
*The illustration shows a pastoral scene - a dirt road leading to a house surrounded by fields. The path seems to emerge from the book and unfolds before us. We feel the fresh breeze and smell the wet soil. We are standing in a puddle in the middle of the road. The wind carries raindrops, and a huge, rural house stands before us.*

=>Reveal **tile Y** unless it is already revealed.

=>Relocate your Dreamers to the `start` space on **C2**.

=>Reveal **card H**.

# 285
*Swamp water spills over the deck boards, pushes into every crack, gets under the deck. It's too late to save the ship. The hull breaks in half and the wreck comes to a standstill in the mud...*

*It takes us forever to get back to the surface.*

<u>Failure:</u>

- Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets.

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream - you can still come back here to try again.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers on `start` spaces.

*We swerve between piles of fetid trash.*

*"Don't touch anything," we tell ourselves.*

If this is a `night` space, resolve **all** 3 effects:

- *Ugh, the stench! There is so much garbage here! Disgusting!* - **Seal 2 cards.**
- *Damn it! More broken glass!* - **Spend 2 `red` or suffer 1 `damage`.**
- *Paws full of sharp claws emerge from the darkness, reaching towards us...* - **Place 1 `threat` in this space (max. 1 `threat` per space).**

*Then we notice something else. It seems we have found an escalator leading down. It must have moved once, long ago, but time has long since stilled the gears that allowed the escalator to function. Now it's nothing more than a set of stairs. We hear howling from deep below.*

- Reveal both **tiles X**.

- Reveal **card C**.

If you are not playing alone, take and *silently* read **card G**, but do not share its content with the other players.

# 287
*Beautiful cars, valuable gadgets, envelopes with cash, exclusive attractions - the selection of prizes is overwhelmingly large. It's a shame that we can't choose something truly valuable - knowledge, skills... Wait, they have that here too!*

Each Dreamer draws a number of cards from the Influence Market equal to the number of `ether` on the Dream Gate tile. Next, each Dreamer may gain any of these cards but the total `ether` value of cards gained by a Dreamer cannot exceed the number of `ether` on the Dream Gate tile.

Then, resolve the following steps:

- Reshuffle the **Slumber and Fate decks**.
- Discard **all** `ether` from the **Dream Gate tile**.
- Your Arena cycle ends - resolve **Awakening**.
- Keep this Dream Gate tile - you may enter the **Arena** whenever you want.

*A puff of smoke surrounds the head of the guard with a large cigar in his mouth. When he sees us, he spits out another cloud of smoke, and says in a hoarse voice:*

*"More detectives? Another case in the docks, yeah? I need to find another job."*

*We're not sure if it was an insult or whether he actually took us for detectives.*

*We have to answer carefully.*

**Choose 1:**

-[*"Well, that's exactly why we're here. Let us into the warehouse, there might be some clues inside."*] -> (191).

-[*"It's bad here, isn't it?" we answer, hoping to open him up some more.*] -> (081).

# 289
*"No. No, thank you. It's too spicy. Maybe another time."*

- Nothing happens - take back this card.

# 290
*When we pass through the corridor of light, we find out that it does not lead to any specific place. We see a lot of foggy exits, but most of those places are unknown to us (except for one). Some do not seem to be material at all - we see worlds of fears, longings, memories, ideas, and faith. Being here, we are almost sure that there is no difference between the more material worlds and the more ephemeral ones. Both are just a set of data on some infinite matrix.*

*Regardless, we have to choose one of the exits.*

- Place the Team marker in a Dream Location space on any Dreamworld Map tile.

*The lighthouse has long been abandoned but its mechanism still works and the light constantly pushes back the darkness.*

*Below, we see the remains of a raft floating on the surface of the black water, chained to a rusty structure. The raft is rotten and leaky but could still be sea-worthy.*

*How do you open the big padlock chained to the raft?*

You may discard **1 Key** or discard **1** `gem` to reveal **card H**.

# 293
*We tell them we are only trying to get to the Mill and...*

***"GRNOT! Uoy teg gnihton, now! Or uoy nmad and I'll tell you which way to Brabra!"***

*I don't think they like it too peaceful here.*

- Pay or give them something. It is clear that the thug's outstretched hand is not waiting for a hug. [*Discard any active Item or discard **1** `gem`*] -> (791).

*Or go away.*

# 294
*I remember from somewhere - this situation, this moment... Like an avalanche, images suddenly spill out from my mind, flying fast and superimposing on one another. Too fast, too much at once - the overwhelming surge of recalled memories almost paralyzes me.*

*A laboratory. I have probably known it forever; I am part of it. I know every piece of equipment and every line of code running the machines here. I glide in the air or squeeze my way effortlessly between the wires as I navigate from place to place. I control everything that happens here. I AM the laboratory.*

*I'm so old that all my photos have long since faded. I browse through them, emotionless - all just forgotten moments, completely foreign to me. They are like memories of someone else's life. A sunny village, an old shop in the city - what are these places? Why was I keeping these photos at all?*

*I see a screen with data racing across it, gradually disappearing behind the edge until there are only four flickering items left on the black screen. The walls of the lab begin to shake and fade away. "We'll make it! We must make it..."*

*Once the shaking stops, the laboratory is in complete ruins.*

*Everything is destroyed.*

*The vision disappears but for a long moment, I feel like I'm stuck in an alien body...*

- Gain **1** `ether`.


# 295
*Welcome to the Dream Factory! Where we can manufacture and conjure anything our customers desire. Hell, we shape the way humanity thinks - what people yearn for, what people gossip about, what thoughts caress them to sleep at night.*

*If we don't provide them with dreams that are good enough, they'll start dreaming for themselves. Can you imagine that! There's no way we could compete with that! We'll have to work harder if we want to keep our jobs.*

*We need to extract raw materials: primary urges, needs, and fears. We'll mould and adjust the ratios until it's just right and launch these dreams straight down the production line!*

*"Where are the employees?" you ask? They're around here somewhere; probably just taking a break...*

*Remember, at the Dream Factory, we don't produce junk here! Only the best high-quality dreams exit our doors!*

# 297
*Balshazar is too powerful! We hear the clank of metal and the chains fall to the ground as if nothing more than thin thread. All of it has been for naught! But at least the beast is still on the platform. We can try again...*

=>Spawn 2 Scavengers and reveal **card A**.

*"Hello, is there anyone here? Hello!"*

*It turns out that was someone there. Well sort of...* 

*The answer came from the creaking TV, perched on a dirty table. Someone has left it on. The weather forecast is in progress. Eventually, the presenter notices us and addresses us directly:*

*"Did you come here to have your fortune told? It's not very expensive."*

- You may spend **1** `gem` or **Seal 1 card** to [resolve] -> (144).

# 300
*We access the database and find files related to various projects.*

- **Unseal 5 cards**, gain **3** `gem`, and gain **1 Flaw**.

# 302
*There is a picture in the mud – it's so dirty and damaged that we can hardly tell what it is supposed to to depict. We can make out a path at night and there is someone walking along it. It is difficult to pick out details, as only a dark silhouette is visible. But it reminds us of someone – is this us on this road?!*

- You may suffer **1** `damage` to Relocate to any `night` space or to gain **3** `gem`.

# 303
*"Thank you so much! What can I do to express my gratitude? I see that the lift is not working today."*

*"A glass... of water... please..."*

Gain **card II-34 N (Exquisite lady Note card).**

# 304
*The rats haven't deserted yet. That means that the building will stand for a little while yet. They can peek into the future, you know? And we think that these hungry little rascals look forward to eating us for breakfast.*

- All Dreamers may discard a total of `player` `ether` to remove **card C** from the game and discard all Rats from the Dreamscape.

- Remember that if you don't use this opportunity in the Dream, **card C** will be added to the Fate deck.

# 305
*We decide to side-step this inconvenient situation and turn our attentions instead to the wonders displayed before us. It's best not to think about what happens behind our backs in the shadows, unless it involves us. Out of sight, out of mind.*

- Add **card F (Car thief)** to the **Fate deck**.

- Additionally, you may suffer **1** `damage` to gain **1 Story token**.

# 306
*We are standing on a large balcony with a wonderful view of the factory roofs. Smoke crawls out of the chimneys, creeps down the streets, and, like a snake, climbs the walls, making its way into house windows. This is a cloud factory – white and gray puffs are exhaled from huge cigars, and vast cumulus clouds spread out across the sky in all directions, entertaining viewers with their fantastical shapes.*

*When we finally tire of the sight, we get into the vehicle and depart. We wonder where and for how much we bought it?*

- Gain **card C (Urban Sphere)** if it is still available OR Settle any 1 Business from any spaces.

# 307
*It's hard enough to wash the filth of the underworld from our clothes, let alone from inside our heads. We should be careful not to let this taint inhabit our souls, enticing us to descend and stay down there forever, slowly forgetting about the surface. It is tempting...*

*<u>Victory.</u>* Each Dreamer cures **1** `damage` or **Unseals 2 cards**.

- Discard **all Story tokens** gained in this Dream.

- Reveal **tile Y**, if it's available.

- Place all Dreamers in the `start` space on **A4**.

# 309
*The beast is gone. For good, though? We'll see.*

*It is disturbing that the beings most full of hate, rage, and doubt hold the greatest power over the rules of the dream worlds. It suggests that disbelief is the source of their stability. Is this the secret of our old lost world – a powerful, common lack of faith, that transforms dreams into what we call reality? That would mean that hell is eternal and the world is fleeting. How big would the disbelief have to be to cover everything that exists?*

*Black water stirs, and we see vortices and powerful waves. This is no longer ordinary black slush, it has become something more. We must get out of here as soon as possible. But how and to where?*

*One of the side corridors, most cluttered with garbage, radiates a colourful glow. We hear some hubbub and music coming from there, which does not bode well.*

*<u>Victory.</u>* Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`. Each Dreamer cures **2** `damage` or **Unseals 2 cards**.

- You may discard **1** `gem` to gain **card I (The Boat)**.

- Restore 3 Shopping cards **(II-41 C)**.

- Discard the current Dreamscape.

- Add **all** Items of this Dream that you did not gain to the **Item Market**.

If you cannot return to the **Well space** (e.g. because the Dream/Slumber ends), place the Dreamers in any `start` spaces of the current Dreamscape.

# 312
*A shot in the dark, wasn't it?*

- Each Dreamer discards their Mask. Then, discard **1 Turn**.

# 313
*We find a door hidden behind a curtain. Its hinges creak woefully as we open it. We peer inside and realise it's a dressing room. Probably in a theatre, as there are many costumes and masks... Wait, masks?*

**Find all cards II-41 S**. You can find them in the Secret cards – in this huge, mysterious deck, which you shouldn't peek at without instruction to do so. Do you have them? Surely all of them? Count please, there should be **14** of them.

Now, each Dreamer chooses **2 of these cards**. Don't look at the rules on the Masks for now – pick the Mask cards based only on their *illustrations and names*, and *which ones you are drawn to*.

Then, each Dreamer should find the corresponding Masks in the box. Now, you may read the rules on their backs. These are your **Masks** and their abilities that they grant are now yours to use.

Then, each Dreamer picks ***only 1*** of the **2 chosen Masks** – that will be their **active Mask**. The second one should be placed aside into your personal Storage. We recommend you use this as a spot to place your **sealed cards** (either on top of or below). 

When the game allows you to ***Restore a mask*** you may choose to replace your Active Mask with one from your personal supply. Furthermore, each Dreamer keeps the Mask cards of their Masks (so they can easily track which Mask they own when saving the game).

You still don't know who you are, but the Mask helps a little – *you at least can pretend that you are someone else*.

***And if you almost know who you are (or who you pretend to be), maybe the lift will listen to you?***

The next time you perform the **Check the lift** action, **add 10 to the number of the script** (it will be script **224** instead of **214**). And, so you don't forget, there's a *reminder* on the **"Do you know who you are?"** card.

# 314
*We want to stop thinking about negative things. But would there be any thoughts left? Or would we encounter the void, staring into a terrifying abyss until something worse than bad thoughts arose from it? Or might we actually find a glimmer of hope there?*

- If you have the ***Little Things*** card, you may Block 1 Step on the current Turn card.

Otherwise, place a **Web token** in this space.

# 315
*I swim and swim. Desperately I try to break through a strange wall made of thick silt and luckily I succeed before the last of my breath gives out. Phew!*

- Relocate **2 spaces up and 1 space right.**

Wait! That's a Blocked space! Not this time – in this exceptional situation, you may move here. Treat this space as **non-Blocked** until you leave it.

- You may **Seal 1 card** to gain **2** `gem`.

# 316
*How can we help them? We know we can't fix the world, and not every country is like ours. But... the train is at the platform, and the locomotive is empty and ruined. People are trapped in the carriages (we think they're people? Hard to say...), forcing their hands through the narrow windows, reaching out to us in supplication. For some reason, we can't see their faces – only half-human, blurred features.*

*No one but us looks at the train, as if it was invisible, or not even really there.*

You may try to help them, but how, exactly? If you just want to try anything – you may **Seal 3 cards** and roll the **Luck die**:

- [`luck-3`] -> (610)

The chances are poor and also good deeds often go unrewarded.

# 317
*Calendar pages fall like autumn leaves, quickly and mercilessly, leaving a feeling of emptiness behind. But sometimes one real day is worth all the missed years. It is better to have realised this before it is too late.*

**Add 3 Turns.** Don't use this script again until the end of this Dream.

# 318
*Killed by our blows, the Warden collapses to the ground. Mist begins oozing from his lips, enveloping and thickening around us.*

You have finished this Dream, but was that all you could do? Perhaps you haven't seen everything there is to see...

This Dream neither ends in Victory or Failure.

- Add **tile II-37 Q** (Warden) to the Slumber deck unless it's there already.

- Discard **all** Story tokens gained in this Dream.

- Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets. 

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream - you can still come back here to try again.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.

# 319
*I wait, hoping that maybe today the school bus will come. But it doesn't.*

*Surely there must be a bus somewhere in the city – other than the one that sits here broken and immobile...*

*Could I squeeze through the shattered window and pass through to the other side? Katie says she has done it before...*

- Flip tile **A2** onto its **War side**. Then, Relocate your Dreamer to the `spawn` space on **A2**.

# 320
*A good start – at least for us, because the audience ratings have not changed one jot. Well, we've moved on, and that's what matters.*

- Each Dreamer cures **1** `damage` or **Unseals 2 cards**.

- Resolve the top card from the **Arena Fate deck** (remember to add 1 Dreamscape Slumber Map tile!).

- Resolve the top **Slumber tile** from the **Arena Slumber deck**, but add **1 Morphing** during its setup.

- If you don't achieve Victory in that Slumber, end your Arena cycle and resolve Awakening.

**If you end that Slumber with a Victory:**

– each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`.

– then, move the `marker` on the Dream Gate tile to the next slot, following the arrows, and resolve the script displayed in the slot you've just reached.

# 321
*Illusion... It's here, trying to overshadow, or at least twist, the truth. It's time to pass through these false curtains, no matter what is behind them.*

- Reveal **card B**.

# 322
*We had to wait in line to take off – the first aircraft is a squat plane with six rows of wings, next is a heavy flying barge, leaking grease wherever it passes and dropping some of the scrap metal it transports as it taxis. And finally, our turn comes.*

*This time, maybe we'll catch something valuable during the trip?*

- Take the **top Cloud card** and place it on the Dreamscape according to the **Cloud cards rules** on the **Dream Gate tile**.

# 323
*"Barely worth anything. I chewed, swallowed, and I don't feel anything special – it tasted a bit like a basil leaf."*

You may return this card (unless it is not an Influence card from the Lucid mode or Thorn Knight decks) to the Influence Market to ***Remind*** twice. Then, move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

If you change your mind now and don't sacrifice an **Influence card**, suffer **1** `damage` or **Seal 1 card**.

# 324
*When my victim's blood obscures my sight for one short moment, a strange dream appears to me...*

*It's an odd vision. I'm in a laboratory. Something is wrong though, because everything starts spinning. The whole
world dances around – the sun, stars, earth, red flowers, all twirling faster and faster. The movement triggers some deep layers of memory, like deja vu, and yet I can't shake a feeling of foreboding that this is a dream that will soon turn into a nightmare.*

*I remember the endless dance, I remember great joy and pride in every step. I dance with my own reflection, trying to be quicker than it and failing, obviously. I stumble, falling through the floor as if it was water, and find myself drifting off
alone in the void... All I can see is a clock, ancient and vast, that doesn't want to reverse time at any cost, towering over me like an executioner. Its hands turn faster and faster, splashing drops of red mud all around.*

*In the void, I notice a bright, welcoming window in which someone has placed a protective amulet. A dreamcatcher...
I hear a steady beat breaking through the void and silence. I move hopefully towards the light, but as I get closer, the glow fades, and the beat quiets and slows down. By the time I reach the window, I find nothing but complete darkness and silence. Again.*

*Well, it was only a harsh dream. Although... something about it still bothers me.*

- Gain **1** `ether`.

# 325
*"Please speak louder! Mouth closer to the microphone! Not that one, it's broken... The one on the right! OK, now I can hear you. But I don't understand. Please repeat, just slower..."*

- Reveal the **top 2 cards** from the **Train deck**. Place each of them on the empty platforms with the next longest lines. Place the Train cards in such a way that each one covers the 2 upper spaces of the Map tiles with winding railways. You *can't do this* if there are **Dreamers**, **Entities**, or a **Train** in those spaces.

- If ***all*** platforms are full, you can't place a new Train – put the drawn Train(s) at the **bottom** of the Train deck.

**OR**

- ***Switch*** the places of two already-placed Trains.

# 326
Just to make sure – did you meet the condition stated above the action? There ***can't*** be any Entities in **range 1** from the space with this action to use it. Not that we suspect anything, we just want to make sure. Remember also that you **can't measure range through a Wall**. If we're all good – let's continue.

*We feel like small children when looking at this table. We can barely peer over its top, and there is a pencil the size of an arm lying on a pile of crumbling papers.*

*Behind the pile, we spot something that is probably a game. What else could it be with all those dice, notes, and tables? It must be old, as it's covered with a sticky, fluffy blanket of cobwebs and dust. Are we about to start a game? Something was chasing us, we were running... No, we were here, playing for a long time. Sitting in a cozy room, slightly bent over the table. The game is so immersive we almost forgot it was just a game! We look at the box again – release date: 1937. Many wires and cogs stick out from under the box lid, which is covered in more writing – let's have a look.*

***"This is no ordinary game, but a mental device that tells a story about the players who play the game. They need to find something they lost long ago."***

*What's all this? A game about players playing the game? A device? Nonsense. It's just an old, simple game, surely. Although...*

- Reveal **tile V**. This is another map tile. Remember how to place it? The tile is labelled **B3** so this goes directly below the **A3 tile** if you line it up with the board spaces.

By the way, some of you have probably already ***reshuffled*** your **Discard pile** a few times. Did you remember to pay a **penalty** for this? If not, remember the **Reshuffle rule**. [Go to] -> (450.2) for a reminder.

You'll be fine on your own from now on, right? [***Oh before we go there is one last thing...***] -> (326.1)

# 327
*We did it! We grabbed everything, ha ha! The shopkeeper didn't even notice, he didn't have time to blink!*

*We watch the old shopkeeper close the shutters and turn off the lights. The next day the building is empty, with only a gray hand-written sign stuck in the window: "For rent."*

***Was that our fault?***

- Gain **2 Train Tickets** (from the **Item Market**), **1 Key**, and **5** `gem`. Then, remove the **Old Shop Fate card** from the game.

# 328
[Is this the ***Sunken Room*** or the Specialist's
***Dark Room***?] -> (864)

[Or a **Dream Gate tile?**] -> (571)

# 329
*Here, the first thought was born. Here, time began. Everything has its source in this place. On the floating debris, we see images of old horned deities from forgotten wild forests, ancient winged guardians, and mysterious crawling sages. They changed names and appearances countless times, transforming into stars, planets, warriors, and kings, always present and ready to reveal their power at an unexpected moment.*

*We can ask for their help – although we must remember that we know very little about these primal beings.*

- You may discard **1** `gem` to cure **all** `damage`.

*"Stop! Everyone listen, stop working immediately! How can you be exploited so easily? Now, let's talk about working conditions first, because it can't go on like this anymore."*

- If the **Union Leader** is ***not*** revealed, reveal **card B** and **Spawn the Union Leader **(use the Masked Man).

**Beware**: if the Workers track reaches any of its ends, the Dream will end in failure!

# 331
*"Well, yes, of course, there is a place from which you can examine the stars. I may be willing to lead you there. But why should I? What's in it for me?"*

- You may return any **Item** (**active** or from the **Storage**) to the **Item Market** to [resolve] -> (636)

# 332
*You may try to gain **1** `marker` here - it's required to open the gate. And you'll learn how to use the **Luck die** and how to influence its result. So, let's begin.*

**Roll the Luck die.**

`luck-x`/`luck-blank`= ***Too bad, you failed!*** Does this mean that you paid for the action, but you didn't gain anything? Yes, unfortunately, your action has failed and any intent spent for it has been wasted. Lady Luck in this case has not favoured you but if you have any `gem` you may discard one to reroll the die. And you may do it as many times as you have the necessary `gem`. If you don't have any - that's also too bad. It's might be an idea to gain some before coming back here again to do this action.

`luck-1`/`luck-2`/`luck-3` = It works! Place **1** `marker` on the Dream Gate tile (the large square card with **"Gate to the First Dream"** on it) and then `block` this action. 

*See? There wasn't a `block` icon printed on the map tile but sometimes it's hidden inside the script itself - many additional effects may take effect inside the script.*

# 333
*I hope that these malicious spiders finally leave the underground once and for all.*

- Remove **card A (...And spiders)** from the game...

- ...But add **tile II-37 R (Dreadful Spiders)** to the Slumber deck.

# 334
*It's twelve o'clock. Something emerges from the darkness – a room with drawings on the walls.*

*There are blocks with letters scattered all over the floor.*

- Reveal **tile Z** unless it's already revealed.

- Reveal **card D**.

# 335
*Is this marsh too big to explore fully? Oh, what's that? There is something here. Interesting...*

- **Restore 1 Item**.

- Then, **Relocate 2 spaces right and 1 space down**.

# 336
Which **Deliverance Card** did you use?

- [**Rage**] -> (1027)

- [**Intimidation**] -> (1134)

- [**Deception**] -> (1061)

- [**Understand**] -> (1223)

- [**Open yourself**] -> (1156)

# 337
*"Well, here you are! Break time's over, get back to work!"*

*The cheerful buzz dies down, and all eyes turn to us with undisguised reluctance. Slowly, sad characters rise, everyone seems to be carrying a gigantic weight on their shoulders.*

- Reveal **tile X** (if it's not revealed yet) and place a `marker` token in the **gray space** of the **Workers track** (if there wasn't one there yet).

- **Spawn 1 Worker** in any chosen **Checkpoint space**.

# 338
*"Trains? There are always some trains you can board. Like this one."*

*We turn around – they're right! We hadn't noticed it before.*

- You may place **"Ramshackle Locomotive"** from the **Train deck** (if it's not yet on the board) at any platform.
If there was a Train there already, discard that one to the **bottom** of the **Train deck** first.

- Some of these trains can get you to places that you cannot reach in any other way. Check the Dreamworld map yourself – look for cut-off stations.

- Gain **tile W (Horizon Dreamworld Map tile)** unless you have it already.

# 340
*It seems to be working fine. We pull up the security feed: there is movement in Zone B3 (probably some animals). We gain access to the system – we can open and close airlock doors. Oh! There are some gems on the desktop: Minesweeper, Solitaire, and Tetris! If we had some free time, we could beat all the high scores... Maybe later?*

# 341
*We recognize the face of a man we have met on one of the floating stones. The inscriptions are weathered, but we can discern a name, Stephen, and there are also some numbers... No matter how hard we try, we can only read the last two digits:* ***"...79."***

# 342
*Wherever you go underground, by stairs, elevator, or ladder, you'll immediately find yourself in another city, away from the sunlight and the 'normal' world above. This city has long tunnels full of shops, crowded train stations, and squares bathed in artificial light bustling with people. You could wander through the whole Endless City without ever going back up to the surface.*

*The only differences between this level and the surface are the silence and the shady-looking characters.*

- **Relocate to any space.**

- Add **tile II-37 I (Strangers)** to the **Slumber deck**.

# 343
*We think we found the exit we were looking for!*

- Reveal **card E**. You may place it so it connects to any **exit** leading out of the park.

- The tile to which you add card E can *no longer be rotated*.

# 344
***Ship's log 01.***

*Look at the night sky: the large surface of the Moon, the small bright dots of Mars and Venus, and the countless stars of boundless space. Our dreams and visions have always been targeted at the vastness of the sky.*

*Is there life different from ours out there? Is there anyone similar to us? Is there a god, a great teacher, up there somewhere? Is space our destiny, or will we always live down here?*

*Earth is our cradle, but how long can we stay in the cradle? At some point, we must breach the final frontier. Will we take the next big step during our lifetime? What awaits our race when we finally set off on that long journey? Is there any hope for us there?*

*Our knowledge, progress, and the problems of our civilization are just a drop in human time, in the infinity of eternity... We send signs of our existence into space, screaming at the void like children, although we do not believe anyone is really there. We're still living down here, on our little planet.*

*Today, only a few trained astronauts are destined to reach the sky and look at our blue planet from a distance, delving into the first layers of the cosmos. I am one of them. I'll start the mission tomorrow. Our objective: a station in the Moon's orbit. New safeguards are in place and we'll be using a new formulation of an extremely efficient fuel has been tested for a year.*

*Now everything is ready. There are eleven hours left until the final countdown. I spent my last evening before the flight with Alice. I won't see her again for half a year.*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`.

- Cross out the number on the **"Reading the Ship's log"** and write a new one: **"003"**.

# 345
*Everything around it trembles and blurs for
a moment. Soon, it stops – and everything is back to
normal. No, not quite everything... something is subtly different.*

Remove the **Awakening Wisdom card** from the game.

- Place **card II-41 N** (another Awakening Wisdom card) in its place.

- Find the **Delta Phase tile** in the Slumber deck and *remove it from the game*.

- Add **tile II-38 B** (another Delta Phase? Yes, similar, yet different...) to the Slumber deck, then reshuffle the Slumber deck.

- Find the **"Vanishing Point" card** in the **Fate deck** (if it's still in the game) and *remove it from the game*.

That's it. Remove the **"Button"** token from the game.

# 346
*The station's chaos tries to engulf us again but this time we are prepared for its schemes. We avoid looking at the strange clock with its crazy hours, we focus on the details of the floor paving, on the familiar walls, sounds and a gentle birdsong that comes from high up under the roof.*

*We notice a few blades of grass bravely growing from between stone slabs, reclaiming a spot for nature from this most industrial of settings. We cherish the sight of the huge clouds drifting by outside the station windows. With this focus, we can avoid drowning in this turbulent crowd. Chaos' grip loosens slowly.*

*So, what are we supposed to do here?*

# 347
*Blue birds... That's a good omen. I like to look at them in the sky. It is enough to thank them silently – and wait for what they will bring us. It always works.*

**Choose 1:**

- Gain **1 Hour.**

- Cure **1** `damage`.

# 348
*When the black goo reaches our knees, it's hard to even keep moving. In some places it is less sticky – but simultaneously deeper at the same time. Something is moving below the surface, though we never catch a glimpse of it. We hope it will keep its distance. Abandoned furniture and equipment float on the surface – the condensed waste of many people's lives. In the end it all has to go somewhere; we have found that somewhere. But something else is hidden at the centre of this sad pond...*

- You may spend **3** `gem` to gain **card H (The Dark Side)** if it is still available.

# 349
*The wave tosses us high into the air – for a split second, we can see a quiet and calm spot in the middle of the storm in the north, its eye. Then, we fall back and are once more at the mercy of the ocean.*

- Relocate 1 Dreamer from this tile to any other space on the other side of this tile's Wall.


# 350
*"I know this – an extremely exotic taste. I never could eat a lot of it at once..."*

Are you sure? If no Dreamer has resolved this script yet, you may remove this token from the game – then each Dreamer ***Reminds twice***, and then moves the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

- If you change your mind now, suffer **1** `damage` or **Seal 1 card**.


# 351
*Not good. We try to make contact with the surface – no effect. Communication with security does not work either. The comms are entirely dead. It seems that as long as someone up there does not notice this failure, we are on our own.*

- Gain **1** `gem` and place a `block` token on this action.


# 352
*"I have to try something new that none of my friends have ever done. I need an adrenaline rush, nothing excites me anymore. I also want to discover something, be the first one – and of course, take good pictures!"*

*"Ok, switch your brain off and follow me."*

You may roll the **Luck die**:

`luck-x` = Gain **2 Flaws**.

`luck-blank` = Gain **1 Flaw**.

`luck-2` = Gain **1** `ether`.

`luck-3` = Gain **1 new random card** from the **Influence Market** for *free*.


# 353
*Despite all the dangers of this district, the neverending barrage of entertainment captivates us to the point where it's getting harder and harder to leave this place. From time to time, we hear the stifled scream of a victim less fortunate than us, but these unsettling sounds are quickly drowned out among the hypnotic music, chatter, and bursts of laughter.*

- If there's `threat` in **range 1**, suffer **1** `damage`.

- You may reveal any **1 unrevealed Map tile** in the same row or column and place your Dreamer in the `start` of that tile.


# 354
*It's not an illusion – a crazy skier pulled by a team of harnessed dolphins rides the raging waves. They all laugh, and their laughter brings smiles to our faces.*

*"Ahoy, friends! Where are you sliding on your cute little shoes?"*

- Reveal **card E**.

- Then, Relocate 1 Dreamer from this tile to any other space on the other side of this tile's Wall.


# 355
*And they said the more mud you have, the more you need. Well, I'm sick of it.*

- Relocate **1 space right**.

- **Draw 2 cards.**


# 356
*The sun hides behind the clouds, the wind starts to blow bringing a chill to the air. Additionally, we can no longer see the mysterious ancient buildings. We look around – there is no trace of the square crumbled by time. Was it all just our imagination?*

*Only the occasional cobble of an ordinary-looking old road emerges here and there from among the tall grass.*

<u>***Failure.***</u> Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets.

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream – you can still come back here to try again.

- Change the Season to **Season of Plague**.

- Reveal 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 357
*We are too busy sweeping ash and carrying rubble from place to place, too busy managing our depressing thoughts that we fail to notice that we're done. The gentle trickling of water makes us realise with a start that they've been banished and we can now take the time to rest. We stop, then draw closer to the once-beautiful plaza in the centre of this gray city.*

*The fountain is spouting streams of sparkling water, the sun has scattered the clouds, and now it shines brightly on the cozy square. The water reflects the sunlight, which unravels the mysteries and the beauty of this place. The sad crust covering the statues crumbles and falls away, revealing their true forms. Some of them smile or dance, others cry or shout in anger – but we know that all emotions are equally important.*

*Then, we catch a flash of silver in the fountain. A single dime, old and forgotten, thrown there by some passer-by who wished for good luck or true love. We know what it is. We had come here for it.*

<u>***Victory.***</u> Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`. Each Dreamer cures **1** `damage` and **Unseals 4 cards**.

- Gain **card H (the 5th Silver Key)**.

- Add **card I (Dump)** to the **Fate deck**.

- Restore 3 Shopping cards **(II-41 C)**.

- Discard the current Dreamscape.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.

# 358
*The storm hates us dearly and we can't escape from it. When we think we finally have a moment to rest, a giant wave crashes over us without warning.*

- Spend **1** `gem` or **Seal 3 cards**.

*The thunder strikes so mightily that the sky shakes, and several stars fall into the sea, drowning in the murky depths. These must be the ocean's treasures about which we have heard so many legends. Maybe we could catch some of them?*

- If you have any **Constellation cards**, place **1** `marker` on any of them.

# 359
*The barren wasteland was once lush and fertile. Dwelling on that fact makes its current state even more difficult to bear. All natural elements have disappeared. We haven't seen clumps of dry grass, stones, or dry stream beds for a long time. We are moving more and more slowly, trudging depressedly across a completely featureless terrain covered only with gray dust. There is absolutely nothing else here. In this part of the world, nothing living or natural exists – there's not even any sound. We don't want to be here anymore...*

# 360
**Close/Open 1 Door**: place/discard `block` from any `door`.

- Closed Doors turn that edge of the space into a **Wall**.

# 361
*Three constellations superimpose over each other forming a new pattern, a silver shape never seen before. They become something more than simply the sum of their parts, something larger and more significant – it becomes alive, slowly gains consciousness. It's hungry. The glow of the newborn constellation will shine brightly in the sky for many years to come.*

- You may remove **1** `gem` or **1** `ether` or **1** `damage` from the markers pool of the game – if you do, each Dreamer gains **2** `ether`.

Then, whether you did it or not, [resolve] -> (688)

# 362
*Observing the boy pays off. We see him suddenly disappear from view, and on investigation we discover a useful passage.*

- Each Dreamer may Relocate to any space on any **Exploration tile.**

# 363
*Nervously and hurriedly, we rummage through the garbage, searching for anything that could improve our situation. We notice light glowing in two different places, as if the darkness was unable to overtake these few items.*

Which of these things do you want to take?

[**A sheaf of papers**] -> (854)

**OR**

[**Something to drink**] -> (913)

# 364
*No one here remembers this terrible past anymore, decades or perhaps centuries before, when there was nothing but countless dreams through which we all wandered, and when time ceased to exist. We will probably also forget about it again soon, but that doesn't matter. The important thing is that we have succeeded. This is what we fought for – we smile blissfully and close our eyes. If only these belts were a little looser...*

*However, when we think more closely about every detail of our surroundings, we come to the realisation that the crawling chaos is always nearby, just beyond a thin veil. True reality is not so material and solid at all, and our adventures have simply stripped us of the notion that cause and effect are linked. We understand that the linear nature of time is illusory, that we are floating on an ever-morphing ocean of possibilities, energy, information, and awareness – all this is simply an ever-growing wave, ready to crash over this world within an instant.*

*We must, at all costs, try to forget this truth and together, continue to dream our one shared dream as long as possible, ignoring the shallow nature of this so-called reality. We will only be reminded of this terrifying truth while asleep, when we leave one body to be born into another, and start the journey anew. But our perfect brains must soon erase these truths from our memories. Otherwise, we could no longer function, and all of this could not exist.*

*So let's welcome it. Let's start the show again!*

<u>***Victory.***</u> Each Dreamer may find and remove **all** their **Flaws**.

- Each Dreamer may **Buy** new Influence cards from the Influence Card Market **twice**.

- Restore 3 Shopping cards **(II-41 C)**.

- Change the Season to **Season of Secret Paths**.

- Discard the current Dreamscape.

- Remove from the game all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks), as well as the Dream Gate tile of this Dream.

***You have finished the second campaign!***

You may save the game now. That's all. You may now start any additional campaigns you have (each one describes how to start it).

If you want to, you may still wander through the Dreamworld Map, visiting Slumbers and Old Dreams (e.g., while waiting for new campaigns).

We encourage you to wait for the next campaigns – as you can see after finishing this one, many changes await!

# 365
[Is it your **Dreamer miniature** (Are you sure? Think about the consequences!)?] -> (665)

[Or your **Companion Entity miniature** (if it is currently on the Dreamscape)?] -> (026)

[Or the **Team miniature**?] -> (687)

[Or **another**?] -> (458)

# 366
*This thing is right next to us, just a little longer and... As if hypnotized, we are still waiting and time seems to freeze.*

- **Stand up and move on** – discard **1 Turn** and [resolve] -> (044)

- **Just wait** – discard **3 Turns** and [resolve] -> (743)

# 367
*We're jumping into the swamp. We managed to leave the ship, the sea of mud and the basement, but we feel that we have left something valuable there. Something we will never find again.*

*Even worse, something sinister followed our trail. We hear tremendous steps, the walls tremble with them.*

Add **tile II-38 R (Mad Swamp Walker)** to the Slumber deck, unless it is there already.

[Resolve] -> (637)

# 369
*Shops and cafes surround the market – they are the real heart of this place. Like white and red blood cells, like endorphins and bacteria, people stream through the streets – they eat, drink, talk and peruse. Maybe we should also buy something? The city lives faster and faster every day. And it grows.*

*A giant clown, as big as a monument, sits in the centre and sells the largest burgers in the world. The queue goes on forever.*

- **Restore 3 Items.**

# 370
*We don't want to think about the future – we have to focus on the present if we want to achieve anything. Our progress is slow. But then, we catch a glint of light out of the corner of our eyes. Or maybe not? Did we imagine it? It seems there is nothing but grayness here.*

*And yet, the beguiling thought of finding that spot of colour in this monochrome landscape won't leave us. We have to check it out, but reaching where we think we saw it means finding a way through the heavy walls made up of ruined stone and cobwebs.*

- Reveal **tile Y**.

- Place a **Web** on each space of the ***Hidden Hope*** tile.

# 371
*We won't be able to squeeze through the bars. Too tight. So, how do we get there? We can only try to reach the light with our fingertips.*

- If any space of **Bl** is `light`, you may spend **4** `green` to place **1** `marker` on the **Dream Gate tile**.

- When there are **3** `marker` on it, [resolve] -> (833)

# 372
*We laugh, letting the cackling sound erupt from the bottom of our hearts. We laugh at the world. We laugh at ourselves. We laugh at all those people who looked down on us. There's half a second of silence, then the echo comes to us. Is it a sad, hollow laugh? Or a heartening one that brings life to the abandoned buildings?*

- If you have ***Little things***, **draw 5 cards**, but discard **all** the ones **without** `green` Intent.

- Otherwise, discard all cards **without** `green` Intent from your hand.

# 373
*A safe haven — at least for the kid - but we must set off over the dark waters again. The kid jumps out of the boat and runs away to safety, not looking back.*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.

- Set **card D (Kid in a boat)** aside – this card cannot appear in this Dream again.

# 374
*This mighty blow makes me feel great! The energy that rushes over me suddenly releases something hidden deep inside, like the memory of a long-forgotten movie. Deja vu is a powerful experience, but after a while, it only leaves an afterimage that is difficult to decipher, like a blurry dream.*

*I'm in some lab and can hear my own heart pounding loudly. Hang on, that's not a heartbeat... Powerful blows shake the closed door, again and again, as if a giant was trying to break through an insubstantial gate. The doors are about to give in and I hear the ominous screech of a great crow. Then the uproar stops suddenly and I look towards the window in fear – there is something outside in the darkness. Scratches appear on the glass – bloodied birds' claws grind against it horribly. "It's me, open up!" a hoarse voice cries from the darkness.*

*I'm not indoors anymore. I stand in the dark in front of a tiny window. There are little helpers next to me – mischievous gnomes, always ready to help out in difficult times. I am so tired, all I want is to finally lie down in my bed and fall asleep, resting before tomorrow where another day of hard work awaits me.*

*Suddenly I hear a metallic clang. I think I've dropped something... But it's so hard to find anything in the dark. The voice comes again, "It's me! Let me in!"*

*I try to snap out of it. The feeling of deja vu disappears again.*

- Gain **1** `ether`.

# 375
*And he seemed to be such a tough guy... As soon as the defeated box is finally torn to shreds, a flattened cardboard pile destined for recycling – (it was actually so fragile!) - we investigate its' contents. Treasure awaits us inside!*

Roll the **Luck die**:

- `luck-x` = Each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`.

- `luck-blank` = Gain **1 Key**.

- `luck-1` = **Restore 1 Item**.

- `luck-2` = Gain **1 new random Item**.

- `luck-3` = Draw **2 random Items** from the **Item Market**, **gain 1** and return the other to the Item Market.

Then, this Slumber ends.

# 376
Which **Deliverance Card** did you use?

- [**Rage**] -> (1052)

- [**Intimidation**] -> (1017)

- [**Deception**] -> (1199)

- *"Don't you remember?"*

# 378
What time does the **clock** on the **Al tile show**?

- [**3**] -> (226)

- [**6**] -> (576)

- [**9**] -> (713)

- [**12**] -> (334)

- [**Other**] -> (804)

# 379
*It's unbelievable! We're almost at the top of the rankings tonight! There is only one more fight that stands between us and the main prize. Almost one hundred thousand viewers are watching our every move.*

*We're on a break, so leeches with microphones and questions surround us, pinning us in one spot. "Where are you from?" "Where did you learn to fight?" "What are you going to do with the prize?" "Do you think the entertainment provided by the Arena is suitable for children?"*

*Deafening music, performed by a brass band with huge drums, stirs our blood.*

*Where are our weapons? Send us somebody we will turn into mincemeat, and send them fast!*

- Each Dreamer may **Seal 1 card** to cure **1** `damage`.

- Resolve the **top card** from the **Arena Fate deck** (remember to add 1 Dreamscape Slumber Map tile!).

- Resolve the **top Slumber tile** from the **Arena Slumber deck**, but add **7 Morphings** during its setup.

- If you don't achieve Victory in that Slumber, end your Arena cycle and resolve Awakening.

If you end this Slumber with a Victory, place **1 more** `ether` on the **Dream Gate tile**. Then, choose one:

– [End your Arena cycle and claim your reward] -> (287)

– Move the `marker` on the Dream Gate tile to the next slot, following the arrows, and resolve the script displayed in the slot you just reached.

# 380
*This is some biological research equipment. There are traces of sticky liquid around and a sample labeled "Wormpeople" is stuck inside. What are they (or we?) working on here? We'd better watch out.*

- Gain **1** `gem` and place a `block` token on this action.

# 381
*"Don't just run around! Get lost, shoo!"*

- Relocate your Dreamer to the `spawn` space on **A4**.

# 382
*We stop exploring the area for a moment, because we hear a strange screech. We turn towards the source of the sound and see a monstrous abomination that is neither altogether human nor bird. This monster must have its lair here. It moves slowly and seems that it doesn't see us. It is blind! We aren't totally lucky, though, because the monster starts to sniff around intensively.*

- Reveal **tile W** and **Spawn the Scarecrow**.

- Place **Trace** tokens in each space with Dreamers (1 **Trace** token for each Dreamer in that space).

# 383
*A huge hole, a hundred feet in diameter, surrounded by scaffolding and fences, grows in the ground between three high apartment blocks. Diggers are parked on its edges, and large floodlights illuminate its dark inside. It seems the excavation is going well.*

**Choose one:**

– Take a photo to remember this moment and move on – Settle **all** Businesses from any **1 chosen tile**.

– Try climbing to a higher floor of one of the buildings, to look deeper into the hole – **Seal 4 card**s to [resolve] -> (094)

# 384
*Something is wrong. Our thoughts become vague and hard to hold in our heads, it is difficult for us to comprehend anything more than basic needs, as if we were overwhelmed by stupefaction. It's a plague. It got us. Will we stay here forever?*

<u>***Failure.***</u> Each Dreamer gains **1 Flaw card**.

- Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets.

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream – you can still come back here to try again.

- Change the Season to **Season of Emptiness**.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.

# 386
*The riddled door creaks like a doorbell as we open it. There is only one large room inside. We hear footsteps – it's probably the host, but our fear increases with every step. We also see that darkness is slowly creeping in through the windows and the doorway. The air begins to electrify and crackle. We don't have much time!*

**Choose one:**

– *We take the papers* – gain **card K**.

– *We take some of the valuables (the shelves are full of them!)* – add **1 Morphing** and split **6** `gem` between **all** Dreamers on **C2**.

– *This was a bad idea, and we run as there's no time to grab anything* – each Dreamer in this space **draws 3 cards**.


# 387
*Hmm... Useless garbage discarded by their previous owners. Some incomplete packs of cards, a blown-out dandelion, a foxed photograph of a cloud, a broken bicycle wheel, a snapped rope, a boring, half-read book, a brush encrusted with dried paint, old batteries that no one has ever used... Oh, and there's a mask.*

If you have only **1 Mask**, you may spend **2** `ether` to gain **1 new Mask**.

*Decide quickly, because...*

*We hear a grim voice: "What's going on there? Stop! Show your papers!"*

Relocate **the Warden** to this space. Add **1 Morphing**.

# 388
*See who came home...*

*"It's Skylight! Finally, it's back! I can finally take it and cherish it forever!"*

*"No, I will never let you – it stays with me until the end of my days..."*

*"It's mine, not yours! Give me..."*

*"Come on! Let go!"*

*So, it looks like we did not help. The problem was elsewhere, it wasn't the lack of Skylight.*

*Let the court decide. All eyes of the house are on us.*

Discard **The Skylight Doll** and decide:

– [The Skylight Doll **stays with the Locker**] -> (396)

– [The Skylight Doll **stays with the Lamp**] -> (601)

– ["Wake up now - **it's just a puppet!**"] -> (454)

# 390
*Through the dirty glass, we see a small dining room. A large table bears a variety of foods and several jovial suited gentlemen sit around it, greedily stuffing their faces. We can't see any doors – how did they enter this place and how do they intend to leave? Through THIS small window? That seems a bit undignified...*

*One of the guests spots us and winks at us through his monocle with a wry smile.*

- Gain **card II-41 B (The Right Mood Note card)**.

# 391
*We're trying to call a rickety lift. The rusty door, which has almost fallen off its hinges, doesn't bode well. We hear distant creaks – maybe it works?*

You may roll the **Luck die**:

- `luck-x`/`luck-blank` = Unfortunately, the lift is out of order at the moment.

- `luck-1`/`luck-2`/`luck-3` = Relocate any other Dreamer to this space (if they agree) OR Relocate your Dreamer to the `start` space.

# 392
*The whole district is falling apart – everywhere, we can see empty tenement houses overgrown with weeds, abandoned scaffolding, collapsing wooden sheds, crumbling roads flooded with mud, and here and there, in spite of everything there are some little shops that are still open, selling all kind of unattractive rubbish.*

*It is a miracle that this building hasn't collapsed yet. Many of the walls have disintegrated completely, revealing its guts – broken stairs, empty apartments... The floor and walls shake disturbingly with each step. And yet – somewhere up there, at the very top, people, mostly elderly, still live here. Our grandmother also lives somewhere in this place – she doesn't want to move out, she'd rather collapse with the building than change anything, because "at my age..."*

*It is the deformed shadow of our home, a grotesque caricature distorted by a nightmare dream world. We have to get to the top. What for? We need to find someone and ask them to open the gates. This time we can't do it alone. There's someone important to us, but... The memory is hazy again, but we know that we are looking for a special apartment and room – a green decorative wallpaper adorns its walls.*

*"Are you still there and waiting? Maybe I'll see you before you disappear forever. I devoted so little time to keeping in touch with you. I didn't think of you often enough. How can I get up to see you now? All the corridors are destroyed and the stairs are broken... Please, be there."*

*We forgot to put on our masks – we quickly stopped pretending because we were at home. Maybe we'll find them somewhere here.*

A note on the **"move through spacings between cards or tiles"** special rule of the Dream Gate tile – it means *a gap where cards/tiles do not touch, because there is a small area between them* (a gap of a few millimeter or more). In this Dream, you cannot use a **Move action** to cross such a gap – you have to use **Jump/Climb actions** (or Relocation actions when possible).

# 393
*It looks like we can sail on this ship and explore this mud-ocean-basement thing... Maybe we'll find out where it ends?*

*We just need to get both parts of the ship together, take the sails from below decks and hoist them.*

- Gain **3** `gem`.

# 396
*It stays with the Locker. It seems like the right decision. A powerful piece of furniture that can close the door to its interior at any time would be a good guardian. And a good role model. That's how you can survive life.*

*How will it end? Nobody knows. That's life, everything may change tomorrow, but what is happening right now is important.*

- **One** Dreamer may gain **card L**, and each other Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.

- Then, [resolve] -> (868).

# 397
*The city chewed us up and spat us out, but we are pleased. We will definitely be back again. There are so many attractions in the city – but how do you find time for all of this? There's always work, urgent business, problems to solve, and when you've done everything, a new day begins – and everything starts again. So many possibilities, and never enough time.*

*"If you fail ... Lord of Water ...who lost his face ... seeking his long-lost reflection ... harass you forever."*

- Gain **1** `gem`.

# 399
*Oh no... We tried reaching too deep and lost our balance. The rushing walls of the well zoom past us, and
everything gets darker. Ouch! We hit the bottom.*

*After a dazed moment, we pull ourselves together and think about getting back up - a difficult task. It's pitch black except for a small circle of light far above us. How will we get out of here now? The way up will not be easy.*

- Suffer **1** `damage`.

- Discard **1** `gem` or **Seal 3 cards**.

# 400
*If we could decode the signal here, we would be able to read the intercepted messages from the space travelers – that would be great, wouldn't it? Furthermore, if we broke the code, perhaps we could establish a form of basic communication – exchange mathematical formulae, or the coordinates of our planets. Where are they from? Who are they? Are they like us?*

*The signal is already in the memory of our computer network. We need to turn on this Decryption Machine.*

- Gain **1** `gem`.

# 401
*We've been travelling for over a week, and the port is still not in sight. There are only thick clouds to be seen – darker and more menacing than ever. We tried to descend a little, to get further from the sun, but it had no effect. Regardless of whether we are rising or falling, the only things we encounter are clouds. The crew loses hope that we will ever break free from this endless sky. Some dejectedly look down, teetering much too close to the void for comfort, their thoughts darkening with each moment. Perhaps plummeting to one's demise would be better than this interminable endlessness.*

*Deep in the blackened sky, we see blue lightning streak threateningly downwards. Growling thunder shakes the airship. I think that it's finally over.*

=>*<u>Failure.</u>* Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets. 

=>Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream – you can still come back here to try again.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.

# 402
*We pull the poor man gently as if we were handling fine china and try not to break his brittle bones. He is as light as a bundle of dried twigs.*

*Will helping someone in such a deplorable state even make a difference? He lies in the rain, his toothless mouth gaping trying to catch individual droplets as they fall. After a while, he slowly drags himself towards the nearby building. Maybe that was enough? Let's return to our own business.*

=>Take **1 Blank token**, and write **"Newcomer, 10..."** on it. Put it in the **Storage**.

*We hear a grim voice:* ***"What's going on over there? Stop! Show your papers!"***

=>Relocate the **Warden** to this space. **Add 1 Morphing**.

# 403
*We should slow down, take a moment to listen to our hearts. If we want to lie down, we should allow ourselves to stop and rest. If we want to sit and lose ourselves in the vast expanse of the sky, give in to the sweet temptation of junk food, and meditate, dreaming within dreams – we should do it. Then, after we have taken some time for ourselves and regained the will to live, we should act.*

*But on the other hand do we even deserve to rest? Maybe we are just so pathetically worthless that we don't deserve anything? We'll never amount to much, all we do is pointless and we're just a waste of space...*

=>If you have the ***Calmness*** card, add **2 Hours**.

=>Otherwise, resolve the ***Heavy Thought*** effect (if it's active).

# 404
*"File not found."*

*The files we are trying to access are corrupted. There's nothing to be gained here.*

*"I like to eat things – otherwise they are wasted, rotting and decaying over time. You won't find a better fate for them. Give me that!"*

=>You may return this Item to the **Item Market**, then each Dreamer ***Reminds*** three times. Then, move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

**OR**

# 408
*The signal returns, the voice is clearer!*

*"[Strange voice] We... serving your... Bright light... [static]*

*"We've made a contact with you, although it is difficult to understand you through the interference. We are picking up your signal via telepathy. Our planet is 39.3 light-years away from you. Can you hear us too? Give us a sign. Where exactly is your planet located? We are your friends. Have you been watching us for a long time? Are you like us?*

*"[screech]"*

*And again – sparks, smoke, the signal disruption gets worse.*

- This computer is **damaged** – mark it with `threat`.

[If **tile W** is not revealed] -> (632)

# 409
*We try to find something useful in these crates. It's unlikely we'll find anything, but we must have hope.*

You may roll the **Luck die**:

`luck-x`/`luck-blank`/`luck-1` = *Sawdust. It's good quality, but how could it be of any use? We've only wasted time and energy.* **Seal 5 cards.**

`luck-2`/`luck-3` = *A map of the front line!* **Add 2 Turns.**

# 411
*The mighty, eternal darkness is held at bay once again – just for a moment, but that's all we need. When our lights flash in unison, more street lights flare into life and windows illuminate in houses in reply. Finally, a giant red glow appears on the Eastern horizon. It worked! It's a new dawn. Once again, the day won the battle against the night. Thanks to us, this time.*

*We can now put out the street lights. We notice that our bulb has changed a little – in the light of the new day, it shines and shimmers like silver.*

<u>***Victory.***</u> Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`. Each Dreamer cures **1** `damage` or **Unseals 1 card**.

- You may Seal another 1 card to remove **card F (Car thief)** from the game.

# 413
*The girl hides in a drawer, relieved, and falls asleep, shrinking to the size of a small doll as she is welcomed into the arms of Morpheus. 
Her two braids don't shrink with her but become her pillow and quilt. It's better to leave her sleep.*

- Discard this **Fate card**.

# 414
*We smell old paint. The pictures on the wall are all faded. One depicts a beautifully-decorated lamp and a brand new locker. Between them stands a small 'something', vaguely reminiscent of a scarecrow with a shining head. It moves in the photo like something malleable, full of possibilities, something that has yet to decide on its final form – furniture, equipment, something else. It continues reshaping itself until finally it settles on the form of a toy.*

*Its shadow seeps from the photo, glides across the floor, and disappears down the dark gap between two floorboards.*

- You may discard **1** `gem` to examine more photos:

[A sunny day in the park] -> (716)

[A large family around a big table in a garden] -> (430)

=>Suffer **1** `damage`.

=>Discard the **current Turn card**.

# 418
*We rummage through the rubbish, despite it having been searched many times before – and the residents of this district have indeed been meticulous. We don't know why we are doing this – maybe to blend in, to stop being the 'funny' outsiders, to find acceptance.*

*Then, we notice a glimpse of something precious and shiny.*

=>If there's `threat` in range 1, **Seal 3 cards**.

=>You may **Seal X cards** to gain **X** `gem`.

# 419
*We approach the high wall to examine its surface.*

*Suddenly a inky black spot appears on the lit wall and, somewhere high above us, we hear the flapping of wings getting louder as the shadow grows quickly. As the noise reaches an unbearable crescendo we see dirty, curved claws emerge from the darkness, lunging for us!*

=>**Seal 3 cards** or suffer **1** `damage`.

*The shadows and cacophany recede as suddenly as they appeared.*

=>Reveal **card E**.

# 421
*A similar mechanism to the one we started at – a metal chest and a big red button – has been built into the sharp, wet rocks of the cave. We already know what to do. After some effort to reach it, we push the button. This time, the grinding of underground mechanisms is much louder and reverberates around the cave, and further still.*

*The eerie howl of a mighty beast comes in reply, easily audible despite the echoing grinding.*

=>Reveal **card G**.

# 422
*Today we produced three dreams that have never been seen before. Perhaps there have been similar ones, but identical? Never before! What a shame that they will only exist in someone's sleep for a moment before being forgotten... After all, they are not sturdy stone monuments, but ephemeral dreams. If I could give you something real, believe me, I would. Alas, this whole world ceased to be real long ago.*

Well, you didn't exactly do well. In fact, you have **failed**.

Just kidding, we know that you wanted to explore the whole area and test all the possibilities.

It's not a problem for now, but in other Dreams, the penalty can be painful. Remember what curiosity did to the cat...

This time, just **reshuffle all Turn cards** and make a **new 12-card Turn deck**.

# 426
*We've been following this mysterious path for a long time. Like everyone, we traced many roads at the same time. Sometimes we stray from them, sometimes we return to them. The roads disappear and reappear, because such roads cannot be seen in the physical world. But in the end we have arrived here – a hidden place. It's a miracle we even found our way to it.*

*In the north we can see the outlines of some buildings, from the west comes the sound of waves. The sky is clear and the sun burns mercilessly. The heat is unbearable. It's a shame we don't have anything to drink with us. The sky is vast, bright and blue, but nevertheless the stars are clearly visible – strange unknown constellations hanging above our heads.*

*Before us, we can just about make out the remains of an ancient, stone-paved road, crushed by time, reclaimed by nature.*

*I don't think we're alone here.*

# 427
*The sand crunches under our feet, and our legs carry us steadily down the slope to the gentle hills.*

=>Reveal **tile X**.

# 428
*The fog rises and thickens, obscuring the moon, lanterns, and the wet street pavements. We can't see anything, but we hear the stomping of heavy boots – wardens are here, surveying the streets and enforcing convoluted laws. They walk steadily, as if it doesn't bother them that they can't see anything through the pea-souper.*

=>Add **tile II-37 Q(Warden)** to the Slumbers deck unless it's there already.

*We notice that all the strands are interconnected. We find an intersection – a sort of centre of gravity in this place – from which we can reach almost any other place. We won't be as skillful as spiders since we have only four limbs, but with a little effort, we can follow their paths.*

- If there is *more* than **1 Web** on the ***Hidden Hope*** tile – *our search is fruitless*. **Nothing happens**.

- If there are *fewer* than **2 Webs** on the ***Hidden Hope*** tile – you must Relocate to **ANY** space with a **Web**.

# 430
*When we look at the picture from one angle, the day is sunny, and the garden is beautiful and well-kept. The joyful family is immersed in conversation, and children play and run around. When we look from a different angle, the garden is empty, neglected and choked with weeds. The skies are grey and menacing.*

You may roll the **Luck die**:

=>`luck-x`/`luck-blank` = **Seal 2 cards**.

=>`luck-1`/`luck-2`/`luck-3` = **Unseal 2 cards**.

# 431
*It's a good decision as I don't have much sail-cloth to spare, but how do I reef the sail? I tried pulling it down towards the boom but it only ripped more.*

*It must have been my imagination but the tear looked like a gaping maw, the ragged edges giving it the impression of teeth. The boat unexpectedly rolled under me, I lost my footing and fell headfirst into the hole.*

*I must not have been tasty because the sail chewed on me once, then unceremoniously spat me back out.*

- Suffer **1** `damage`.

- Don't discard the current Turn card.

# 432
*It's getting harder and harder to breathe here, and I'm so dirty I feel embarrassed. There's nothing but dust everywhere. It's so dark...*

- Flip **tile A4** onto its **War** side. Relocate your Dreamer on the **A4 tile** to the **BUS space**.

# 433
*It feels like we're floating in the air. The fear is barely perceptible at first but gradually it starts to grow eventually enveloping us like an unbearable stench.*

*It doesn't really help.*

- This Slumber ends.

=>Relocate to any `water` space.

=>Draw 1 influence card.

# 436
*We climb the furniture and reach for the top. There's a sack full of potentially valuable rubbish stashed up here – like so many unnecessary thoughts in our heads. The bag's contents turn out to be useless to us, but the container itself may prove helpful. We never know what we'll have to carry with us.*

=>If the Locker is in this space, you may add **1 Morphing** to reveal **card F**.

=>Finally, you may **Move the Locker 2 spaces** or **Relocate the Lamp to any tile**.

# 437
**Domain: Reincarnation. Project Objective: The preservation of selected practical skills in the reincarnation process.**

*For such a relatively young domain (of only twenty years), the milestones we have so far achieved encourage us to make further, increasingly bold attempts. We must, however, aim for balance, restricting our influence to a modest extent so as not to disturb the critical principles of the life cycle.*

*This is especially important due to the potential for feedback and the ensuing exponential acceleration of scientific development – 
given that our specialists retain their acquired knowledge after rebirth.*

=>Gain **card H (Throwback)**.

# 438
*The underground corridor ends at a solid oaken door. We try to open it, heaving with all our might. Stuck fast. "Maybe if we weren't so small at this very moment..." we think to ourselves.*

=>If you have the **Blue Key**, remove it from the game, [and resolve] -> (951).

=>If you don't have the **Blue key**, you won't accomplish anything here. *Go back to the exit.*

# 439
*Let's look at this dream...*

*We hear the creak of the mast. The echo of a voice, distorted by radio static, mixes with music echoing over the waves of the inky black ocean.*

*The yacht is not sailing today, but moored in the harbour. Each guest on deck holds a glass of sparkling champagne in their hand. And there is something to celebrate – our family has taken control of another district of this city today. Suddenly, a mooring line snaps and the yacht tips. Among the panicking guests, I see suspicious figures dressed in black...*

*Rating: Decent, but it certainly isn't a work of art. But there is luxury and power, so ok, we'll take this dream.*

=>Place **1 Story token** on the **Dream Gate tile**.

=>**Unseal 1 card**.

=>If the **Union Leader** is *not revealed*, [resolve] -> (330).

*We run, shout, burn with rage as if the world was over, as if our lives have ceased to make sense in an instant. We missed our train...*

*And for us it's the greatest tragedy that could ever have happened in our lives.*
 
*Faces of other people become irrationally repulsive, the sounds and smells of the world become unbearable. Of course, in a few days it will have become unimportant, but now...*
 
*We have lost perspective, our internal compass shattered. Like most of the people here.*

# 445
*The protege is out of steam - his life is running away faster than he can chase it. He's left with his own thoughts, pondering how it happened, the steps that led him to this sorry state.*

*We can't hear his prayers any more. We close our weary eyes, and the gray city disappears, finding ourselves back in the place and time where we first heard his call for help.*

=>Move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

# 450
*Through the abyss, we crawl out from the cold dark rift to... we're not quite sure. Where are we? What is our mission? More importantly, who are we? In our gut we know that something went wrong, possibly catastrophically wrong.*

*We thought we still remembered a moment ago but now, just like grains of sand slipping through our fingers, our memories have also disappeared. That feeling of trying to remember an elusive dream upon waking from a deep slumber...*

*We have some equipment with us but we're not sure what it's used for. Everything functions differently here. Things decompose into scrap in an instant and just as easily reform into other things. If we put something down for a moment, sometimes it transforms immediately into something else.*

*We hear song birds. We smell wet earth after the rain. Petrichor – we recall the curious name of this scent. We remember that we wandered through a maze of forest paths, each too similar to the last. But we're still in the woods and probably have been for a very long time. Dirty, torn clothes, burning muscles, a consuming hunger. Memories of being pursued rise from the depths of our memories - we had barely escaped and the fear gnaws at the edge of our minds. Fog rises from the steaming earth. The golden rays of the setting sun shine behind the trees. Komorebi – another pleasing word. It's getting cold, though. We must hurry. Finally, we reach a lea in front of a rock wall with massive gates.*

***The imposing gates are locked. There are three locks, each with a symbol identical to that on one of the pedestals next to it – a leaf, a padlock, a wave. A small tree grows on the first pedestal, a large rusty padlock is attached to the second one, and on the third is a stone ewer from which water flows endlessly. Unconsciously we know that through gate is the way to our escape. Now just to open it...***

**This is the beginning of the tutorial segment.** There may seem like there are a lot of rules up ahead (and there are!) but we'll attempt to walk you slowly through it. Let's practice the basics then.

This is the start of a Dream and you're looking down at a bird's eye view map of the area around you. Each **MAP TILE** consists of four **spaces**.

![Map Tile](/assets/images/secrets/secret-tile.jpg "Map Tile")

Place your Dreamer miniatures in `start` **(Dreamer's Entrance)** spaces. As the `start` symbol straddles two spaces, you may choose *either of them*. A space can contain at **most 4 figures** - these are combinations of Dreamer miniatures and/or other miniatures.

A **TURN** will consist of a **DREAMERS PHASE** where all Dreamers will draw up to **4 INFLUENCE CARDS** from their **Influence Deck** to their *maximum hand size* which is typically ***6***, followed by a **DREAMSCAPE PHASE** (more on that later). So for example, if you had 3 cards in your hand already at the beginning of the Dreamers Phase you would only draw 3 cards, which brings you to your hand size of 6 cards. Similarly if you had 4 cards, you would only draw 2 cards. ***Before you draw you may discard any number of cards.***

However you have *no cards in your hand* at the moment so **DRAW 4 INFLUENCE CARDS NOW.**

Now let's look around the map.

You see ***3 pedestals*** dotted around the Dreamscape tile you're on and on each one you will practice different actions that make up most of the ***different types of map actions*** that may appear throughout the game. 

***Oh but we forgot one thing haven't we?*** **How do you get to these spaces first?** 

If you look at your hand of cards now you'll notice on the top left they will have a bunch of symbols, namely `yellow`, `red`, `green`. These represent your Dreamer's inner resources or **INTENT** to deal with problems: 

- `yellow` is your **CUNNING** and is mainly related to movement, avoidance, cleverness and deception.
- `green` is your **AWARENESS** and is mainly related to diplomacy, conversation, observation, understanding and aptitude with technology.
- `red` is your **WRATH** and is mainly related to physical actions, fighting, tenacity and argument. 

**Movement**

Now to **move** you will need to discard influence cards with `yellow` **intent** on them - one **intent** for each space of movement. So if you wanted to move your Dreamer **3** spaces you could discard one influence card with **2** `yellow` intent and another one with **1** `yellow` intent. These cards go to a **personal discard pile** (you can keep these face up on the right side of your Dreamer Board) and you get to move your Dreamer miniature to the intended space. Remember that ***you cannot normally move diagonally***. If you decide to move *less than* the number of intent you spent - this is possible also, but any excess intent is lost. In fact with **any** of your actions, if you overspend, any excess influence is lost. 

***Now back to the MAP ACTIONS...***

![Green action](/assets/images/secrets/green-action.png "Green action")

- The **green** one is a simple action with a cost of **6** `green`. To pay for this you will **need to be on this space** and then discard Influence cards from your hand for **Intent** - specifically cards with `green` icons in their top left. So I might discard 2 cards with 2 `green` each (for a total of 4) and 2 more cards with `green` each (for a total of 2) to make up this cost. This all has to be paid in the **one action** by **only one Dreamer**. You may find that you need to keep cards from turn to turn in order to have enough intent to pay for this. Once the cost has been paid, you read the relevant entry in the Secret Script. 

![Yellow action](/assets/images/secrets/yellow-action.png "Yellow action")

- The **yellow** one is an action for **3** `yellow` ***but*** you have to pay it as many times as the number of Dreamers (that's what `player-x` means) in *gradual increments*. We call these **gradual actions** and they are only resolved once the full cost has been met. As before you also need to be on this space to pay the costs. 

So for example if there are **2** Dreamers playing, the total cost of activating the space is **2** `player` x **3** `yellow` = **6** `yellow` intent. This can be paid all at once in a *single action* **OR** progressively over multiple **TURNS** in increments of 3 `yellow` intent, with each payment tracked by a `yellow-marker` **(Yellow marker)** placed on the space of the action. 

To illustrate this, on one turn, *the Free Spirit* might pay **3** `yellow` intent first to contribute to this (by discarding 3 `yellow` intent worth of cards from her hand). You place a `yellow-marker` on the space to represent this. Then on another turn, *the Tough Guy*, can contribute another 3 `yellow` to complete the action, reading from the relevant script. Alternatively if you just had 6 `yellow` intent you could pay it outright and complete the action.

![Red action](/assets/images/secrets/red-action.png "Red action")

- The **red** one is an **Assault action** with a cost of 6 `red` (representing ***wrath*** thematically). This special type of action can be performed at a **range of 1** (the space itself or an adjacent space but *not diagonally*). One action which hasn't been featured on this map is the **Contact action** which is very similar to the **Assault action** but uses `green` intent instead and also has an **action range of 1**. Some of your card abilities will only work with **Assault** or **Contact** actions. Sometimes you might run into actions with "red" or "green" words but if they do not mention specifically **Assault or Contact** they are not these actions.

Additionally, the actions on the **yellow and red pedestals** have a `block` icon, which means that they are **one-use only** – when performed, place a `block` token on them to mark that they are no longer available.

![Gem action](/assets/images/secrets/gem-action.png "Gem action")

There is another action in the lower-left corner of the **A2 tile**. This one allows you to gain **1** `gem` **(shining blue gem)** for **1** `green` intent. The only limit to how many times you may perform it is the number of `gem` available (**6**) – treat yourself to all the `gem` if you like but this might mean that other Dreamers don't have access to them (if you're playing with others). What are `gem` used for? You may use them to **reroll any die**. Why might you want to roll the di(c)e in the first place? [See] -> (450.3) - **BOOSTING INTENT.**

![Free action](/assets/images/secrets/free-action.png "Free action")

In the lower-right corner, there is a **free action** (with a cost of *zero*) – you only have to be in this space to use it. There is also a *wall* close-by - this is an impassable barrier that you can't move through or measure range through.

![wall](/assets/images/secrets/wall.png "Wall")

You'll also note that some of your cards have abilities on the bottom of them that can be used to pay for Intent. These abilities typically allow you to obtain Intent more efficiently. [**To read more about how to use card abilities, go to**] -> (450.1).

***Note that there is no set action structure, so feel to take your actions simultaneously to save time - that is, if you're playing with multiple players.***

When you've run out of things to do (or cards in your hands), all Dreamers will pass and [you'll move into the **DREAMSCAPE PHASE - go to**] -> (450.4).

***As this script is a condensed summary of all the rules of the games（with quick links below), we recommend that you write this number (450) down somewhere in case you need to reference it again during play. We may make a glossary of rules soon, maybe?***

*"My children, don't afraid of these glitches, they are not ghosts – it's actually the house that's unstable. I'm leaving now, because this place could fall apart at any moment. I've made you some hot soup – eat it all up quickly, you mustn't waste food, then leave and be sure to close the door. Don't linger here too long!"*

*A blue light blinds us when we turn the key in the lock. It fits! We go inside.*

*Through a narrow corridor and into a tight bunker, we find a small control room illuminated by blue neon lights. Along the walls, there are glowing screens flooded with technical data and fuzzy views from various cameras. LEDs are blinking erratically everywhere and maps and documents haphazardly strewen across the desks.*

# 461
*We take a deep breath to calm our nerves and a long breath out to release all of our pent-up rage. There is an irritation here that festers at the back of our minds, antagonising our inner composure and tempting us into poorly chosen words and actions. Why does this place stir up such strong emotions?*

*Maybe finding someone who knows something about this could help figure out a way to calm us down and allow us to laugh again?*

# 462
*"Come inside, please."*

- *Not for anything in the world, it's too scary!* - *The hand slows its scrabbling and eventually disappears under the mud.*

a bucket on someone's head a mask?*

=>Discard the current **Turn card**.

# 471
*We carefully inspect the water that flows out of the installation. Interesting – one of the pipes is clogged. We pull out the weeds choking it and the water flows again - gurgling slowly at first but gaining momentum after some time. The stronger it flows, the more clearly we can hear the grinding of some kind of underground mechanism through the floor.*

- Reveal **card A**.

# 472
*The defeated devil lies before us. We have triumphed. Hold on... Why is it smiling, though? Angry, sad, afraid - we expect to see these emotions but triumph? Surely not...*

*Suddenly we hear a gunshot – we turn around and realise the terrible truth...*

- Each Dreamer gains 1 `ether`.

# 476
***Ship's log 03.*** 

*They were aliens that finally came to Earth. "Please come in peace, we beseech you!" had no effect, though.
I don't think we were destined to be their allies. More like pests that needed to be removed, vermin infesting
the planet.*

*There is only fire, destruction, and methodical extermination. How do I get home now? How to come back at all? How can I survive and where can I hide? Maybe I should just stay here. Is this a dream or a nightmare? Neither of course, it's really happening, I can't wake up from this.*

*I firmly believe that nothing bad happened to Alice. No, nothing bad could happen to her.*

*Against the blue and white backdrop of the Earth, there are more and more lights, but they are also getting closer to me. I must leave as soon as possible. A few luminous points disconnect from the new artificial constellation and start heading towards me...*

*There is nowhere to hide, there is no way to come back. Communications are dead. I have no choice, the only way out is to continue my flight. The small disc of the distant Moon shines in front of me like a silvery beacon of hope...*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`.

- Gain **1 Hour**.

- Cross out the number on the **"Reading the Ship's log"** and write a new one: **"232"**.

# 477
*There are almost no webs left in the whole city. We've managed to overcome our own fears, and the vicious spiders are no longer threatening the natural order of things. Small animals start to appear here and there from burrows and holes where they'd stayed hidden for so long.*

*Warily at first, they slowly return to their normal habits. We even see a group of people, tinkering with one of the devastated walls. Is this it? Have we overcome the darkness of this place?*

=>Add **2 Hours.**

# 479
*How is it possible that in such a gray, hopeless place - among all the dirt, creeping rats, repulsive stench, and unhappiness - there is a door from which warm comforting light flows out? It is so open and inviting, why do the people still sit here, instead of giving in to its embrace?*

*The door calls to us, stronger and stronger. Finally we can't resist anymore, drawn to it like sailors to a siren's song. Let's hope it leads to a better place.*

=>Place all Dreamers in the `start` space on the **B2 tile**.

**OR**

=>Gain tile **II-39 K (*"A strange Incident in the Secret Laboratory"* Dream Gate tile).** Then **remove tile A4 from the game**, and each Dreamer may gain 1 new random **Influence card** from the Influence Market for *free*. Finally, place all Dreamers in the `start` space on the **B2 tile**.

- [Remove the headlight] -> (194)

- [Remove the wheel] -> (724)

- [Hide inside] -> (109)

# 488
*A pile of scrap is what remains of the large machine. One glinting fragment catches our attention – a silver spoon. We remember that the Moon Baroness has a collection of such cutlery, seemingly ninety-nine of them. So this would be the hundredth. So that was it! The hundredth teaspoon.*

*Let's hope she keeps her word on the Silver Key. We need it to break free from this chaos we are stuck in...*

=>[Resolve] -> (120)

- Gain 3 `gem`.

- Place any **1 Terrain token** in any space in **range 4**.

- Gain **2 Keys**.

# 490

=>If **card H** is still available in the Secrets of this Dream, you may discard **2 Puppets** and add **card H** to the Fate deck.

# 491
*We will never memorize all this. How did it happen that we lost so much time and only find ourselves in this place now?*

- Each Dreamer may **Buy Influence cards** now – the card prices are lowered by **1** `ether` (to a minimum of **1** `ether`).

# 492
*Ah, the box! I think I know what I can find inside.*

- Look at the **Pool of Items** (**cards B**) and gain **1** of them. Then, place a `block` token on this Map Action.

*A ghastly yet human silhouette looms from behind a vending machine. Or did we imagine it, like we did the monsters in our bedroom as children?* - If this is a `night` space, place **1** `threat` in this space (max. 1 `threat` per space).

# 493
*We recall words from someone wiser than us: "Joy is in simple things. Look around, focus on today, and you won't see despair anymore." But what if we are surrounded by despair and not joy?*

If there is more than 1 **Web** on the ***Life Ruins*** tile:

- *We go down the slide, but instead of joy, we feel numbness. If going down a slide doesn't make us joyful, what hope is there? Well, at least we manage to find a shiny stone.* – Gain **1** `gem`.

If there are fewer than 2 **Webs** on the ***Life Ruins*** tile:

- Gain **card C**.

# 495
*These waters, this harbour – it triggers a memory. Something real, from our old world. All the fumes, garbage, dirt... And this dense fog, which obscures the view and doesn't let us see beyond our outstretched hand.*

*It's like a catalyst – a stream of scenes, intense deja vu, floods our minds: a laboratory full of electronics, sleeping people hooked up to sinister devices, a headline: "The end is coming!" and a small house set in a landscape of rolling hills and fields.*

=>You may *reshuffle* your deck (without penalty).

*The vision is gone. At the edge of my mind, I almost saw my whole forgotten life and the understanding of this situation we're in, like a word that's on the tip of your tongue but won't come out. Just one second more, and...*

*We hear a grim voice: "Who goes there? Stop! Show your papers!"*

=>Relocate the **Warden** to this space. Add **1 Morphing**.

# 496
**Research on the Wormpeople, the soulless inhabitants of the world on the other side.**

*Based on our initial study, we estimate that wormpeople make up 65.7% of the total number of inhabitants, which corresponds to an 8.2% increase on last year. From the outside, they look just like normal people, but they are actually nothing but empty biological shells.*

*It is worth noting that the scientists on the other side do not seem to be aware of the presence of this research facility in their world – perhaps they are blinded by analysis of divisions in categories which have no relevance, like complexion, belief, or wealth.*

*The Wormpeople have failed to develop any manifestation of empathy and self-awareness yet, but perfect mimicry allows them to function quasi-normally, especially as the numbers of their species grows. They see other people only as obstacles, ssometimes even ignoring them completely.*

*To better blend in with the community, they use many effective (and probably instinctual) adaptation techniques taking on the traits of many negative human behaviours such as manifestations of hatred, irrational divisions between people, unnecessary competition, extreme materialism, etc.*

*Recommendations: We must stop this scourge from entering our world at all costs. To illustrate the danger we're facing, even the most fearsome monsters of our world present a lesser threat. They may be fierce, but at least they display signs of feelings and emotions.*

*Wormpeople have none whatsoever.*

**Signed: Professor Shelley and Dr. Goodman.**

# 497
*If **card C** is still in the Secrets of this Dream – you hear a woman's voice:*

=>*"Release me, please. Why are you doing this to me? I didn't hurt you or anyone else. Let me go and I'll give you what you're looking for – the sixth Silver Key. And I'll give you something else too, something almost as precious."*

**Choose ONE:**

- 1 Dreamer may gain **card C**, and the rest of the Dreamers gain 3 `ether` each, then each Dreamer cures
all `damage` and **Unseals all cards**.

- The Dreamers take back the cards they placed as Chains on the Dreamscape (and place them in their Discard pile). If you
choose this option, the Dream will end, and you'll be back on the Dreamworld Map - but first, [resolve] -> (023)

**OR**

[If you don't want to listen or **card C** is not available] -> (673)

# 498
*I'm completely unable to control my rage. I didn't want to hurt our friends at all, I just lost my temper – it happens, sorry.*

=>Each Dreamer in **range 2** suffers **1** `damage`.

# 499
*A blue door – another vibrant colour. What could these colours mean?*

*We open it and go through. That's strange - the room on the other side is identical. We turn around and there is another blue door behind our backs. Curiouser and curiouser...*

Add **card I** to the Fate deck.

# 500
*We look at the displays – everything on show is dangling from cobwebs, twisting slowly and glinting alluringly in the artificial light. The fact that we can't see the spiders doesn't change the possibility they could be waiting in the shadows, ready to strike.*

- If there's `threat` in *range 1*, discard **1 Key** if you have any.

*Suddenly, we notice a suspicious, shadowy figure apparently tinkering
with the car lock.*

**Choose one:**

- ***Ignore them ***– gain **2** `gem` and [resolve](3O5)

- ***Try to stop them*** – **Seal 1 card** and [resolve] -> (412)

[Open yourself] -> (1016)

# 502
*A different world exists at the edge of the city – old villas and thousands of green allotments. They look lovely during the day, but at night they give off a brooding malevolence – it is better not to venture here when the green fog appears after dark. As night falls, dark vines grow and spread over everything, sinister things crawl out of the canals, and the fences become impassable barriers bristling with jagged splinters.*

*And yet, it is only at night that you can find the way through the real gates which lead to far-off lands.*

*But during the day, it's like paradise – each plot of land its own separate, sunny, quiet world.*

**Choose one:**

- *Let's just rest here, basking in the sun and putting our cares aside for a moment.* – each Dreamer cures **3** `damage`.

**OR**

[*Let's return after dusk, despite the dangers. What is imperceptible in sunshine will become visible by the light of the moon.*] -> (73)

# 503
*We look into countless eyes glowing out from the darkness and realize that the danger is not yet upon us. We must strike now, without hesitation. But are we brave enough? Can we overcome our fears and forget about the past for a moment?*

If you have ***Here and Now***, **Paralyze** both Spiders.

![Paralyze](/assets/images/secrets/paralyze.png "Paralyze")

Otherwise, place a **Web token** in any chosen space on the ***Dark Borders*** tile.


# 505
*The wall is full of doors of many shapes and sizes, all obscured by deep shadows which don't disappear when light is shone on them. Disconcertingly, some of the gates turn out to only be ornamental trompe l'oeil (illusions), while others are real and lead through to an abandoned conservatory.*

If the **Lamp is on this tile**, resolve the following:

- Reveal **tile Y**.

- Reveal **card N** unless it's already revealed.

# 507
*All this roaming, searching for a meaning, was all for nothing. But isn't that what life is all about? Fundamentally, is searching all there is?*

*We're standing in front of maps for the neighborhood and the city. "Wait a minute, what's that?" – we begin to wonder. Two different places share the same name: Your Home. The roads to each of them cross a place called Swamp Mill. We can't shake the feeling this means something, especially in this strange world. It might be prudent to copy this part of the plan down – so we take note of everything carefully.*

*<u>Victory.</u>* Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`. Each Dreamer cures **2** `damage` or **Unseals 2 cards**.

- Gain **tile Y (Profundum Dreamworld Map tile)**.

- Add tile **II-37 U (Dogs)** to the Slumber deck unless it is there already.

*After leaving the park, the path soon leads us into a beautiful, ordered forest, interspersed with many tracks. There is a signpost at each junction with distances and travelling times to each destination. These are no ordinary paths, as it appears we can reach far-flung places surprisingly quickly, in mere minutes. Memories can lead us so far in an instant. Maybe it's worth trying one of them out?*

*The tall waves, breaking one by one and crashing into each other, are as dangerous as they are beautiful. We notice pearls, fallen stars, and gilded
chalices rolling in the churning seafoam – treasures claimed by Poseidon, looted from many battles against adventurers and the sky. Suddenly, a wave hits us without warning.*

- Spend **l** `gem` or **Seal 3 cards**.

If you have any **Constellation cards**, place **1** `marker` on
any of them.

**Seal 5 cards** or **discard your Mask**.

# 511
*"Distress? I definitely do not want any pain or depression. Do you think I'm a fool?"*

Do not discard this `damage`, and suffer 1 additional `damage`.

# 513
*Too much information all at once, too much strain on the mind and memory. Letters mix, forming meaningless strings, obscuring everything as if the
whole world was made up of endless columns of green symbols and numbers. We may be seeing a truer face of the world right now, but, unfortunately, we can't function in such a world yet. We need everything to be simplified by several magnitudes, to a small range of waves, to the senses we are used to having. Our brain must learn how to limit and ignore stimuli again – until then, we will be dazed and confused. This is our filter, our converter, we need it to function normally. We must return to the lower level as soon as possible.*

*We look at the rocky precipice and notice soft, emerald-green moss growing on the stones.*

*As we stroke it, it sticks to our fingers and immediately starts to spread, growing up our hands and arms. After a while we're almost hidden beneath a green carpet, like an ancient statue long neglected, and it becomes increasingly difficult to breathe and move.*

You may **Seal 1-3 cards** to `block` the same number of Steps on the **current Turn card**.


# 515

longer such a formidable foe.*

- Return this Slumber tile to the Secrets.

- Add **tile II-37 K (Swamp Walker)** to the Slumber deck.

# 516
*Let's get those cabinets open and check them. First – empty. Second – empty. Third – empty. No, wait, there is something in the third one. A small glass container with... an insect? A chrysalis? It's pulsating gently. Hmm, we'd better leave it alone. Who knows what that could turn into if released. What are they really working on? Or... what are we working on?*

- Gain **1** `gem` and place a `block` token on this action.

# 518
*We feel much better, as always after a day in the park. It's time for a well-deserved rest. Birds sing, the sun shines, a warm summer breeze caresses our skin, and our eyelids slowly droop.*

*The moment our legs leave the roof, the crows' cries die out. It seems that each of these black birds is watching closely, curious to see whether wings will grow from our arms or backs and if we will soar as they do with such grace and ease. Unfortunately, nothing like that happens. Silence prevails until the end.*

# 527

You may **discard 1 Key** OR suffer **1** `damage` and **Seal 3 cards** to gain **card J**.

# 529
*Choices... We often go through crossroads, sometimes even unknowingly. Do we help or turn our backs? Take the ball or the gun? Who can judge us? No one is clairvoyant and our choices are usually made blind. We are like children in the dark, without any foresight. Small choices in the past made us who we are today.*

*This is one of those moments. Will the innocent child grab the gun in the dark?*

You may **return 1 card from your hand** to the **Influence Market** to gain **card I (Assassin)**.

# 530
*We can't predict what will happen tomorrow. One day, we fall asleep with ease, making big plans, savoring our achievements, the next day our lives fall apart. We fall asleep discouraged and depressed, and in the morning our problems disappear like the memory of a nightmare. Whimsical fate follows no mortal rules.*

*Or you are having fun, and then you wake up in a gutter, in the middle of a dodgy district, at the centre of an urban maze full of traps and wild beasts. How to get out of the labyrinth now?*

# 531
*The darkness calms some and repels others. I have always been one with the dark.*

*That's how I always felt – until now, when the terrifying cold of emptiness touches me, finds a way through a chink in my psychological armour, chilling my blood in an instant and obscuring all my senses. I don't want to stay here forever! Let me out!*

- **Seal 6 cards** or suffer **2** `damage`.

# 532
*"Spare some change? Help a man in need?"*

# 534
*A moment to rest and... Well, unless we withdraw and claim what we have already won? Why risk it? But we feel the pressure from the crowds – over fifteen thousand spectators, and we keep attracting more. Fame really is like a drug. Only now, we notice that all around the Arena there are big impressive statues of legendary winners but only tiny crude portraits of the defeated. Hmmm...*

- Each Dreamer cures **1** `damage` or **Unseals 2 cards**.

- Resolve the top card from the **Arena Fate deck** (remember to add 1 Dreamscape Slumber Map tile!).

If you don't achieve Victory in that Slumber, end your Arena cycle and resolve Awakening.

- [End your Arena cycle and claim your reward] -> (287)

- Move the `marker` on the Dream Gate tile to the next slot, following the arrows, and resolve the script displayed in the slot you just reached.

# 535
*A winding staircase leads dozens of metres down. We are already far from the crumbling tenement houses on the surface, but still we feel their presence – their depressing decay reaches even here. The remains of clothes and tools, old rags, photos, and toys flow down the pipes, like the debris of abandoned life.*

*There, deep underground, under the entire district, lives something that feeds on this decay, that feeds off forgetfulness, loneliness, despair – and that catches especially rare pearls in this waste. It is a powerful being whose influence extends to the surface, that satiates its hunger by reaching out to buildings further and further away, dismantling the lives of their inhabitants. We must face this being, discover the source of its power – and survive.*

*Finally, we reach the final step. Black sludge floods the brick corridors and underground halls like the debris of forgotten life. Old furniture and abandoned appliances float around, flowing through pipes towards who knows where. Movements in the water cause rippling echoes in the dark, as if something just below the surface was alive and waiting for its next victim to come along.*

***And here we are.***

# 536
*Domain: Matrix energy (zero-point energy). Project objectives: To transform matter into energy and to introduce new principles of physics into existing reality to a meaningful extent.

# 537
*We see an abandoned residential building, festooned with flowers and ivy. It looks out of place here. When we look more closely, we see warm light emanating from its empty windows.*

- Reveal **tile Y**.

# 538
*The whole district is rotting and falling apart, with scattered debris, pulsing with maggots and crawling things, piled up everywhere. Sidewalks are cracked, trees are warped and withered, a dank gray fog envelops the streets. There used to be a hotel here – today, only part of the sign remains, hanging from the deserted building "...ORNIA". The only light comes from the slaughterhouse – a sinister, red glow bathing the sky. The stench of iron hangs in the air. The door is so smeared with blood we hesitate before knocking, our knuckle rapping wetly.*

*As we wipe the blood off disgustedly, the door opens, and a hulking butcher stands before us, a huge rusty cleaver in his hand, dripping dark liquid onto the floor.*

*"Have you got something for me? I need more commodities. I'm running low and people are still hungry."*

- If you have the Meat Item card in the Storage or Active Items slots (or any Item you may consider a living creature - e.g., Little Helpers), you may return it to the Item Market to [resolve] -> (927)

- If you don't have any such Item, the butcher slams the door shut in your face with an exasperated, "Gah! Waste of time."

# 539
*They say that the whirlpools of the far north are dangerous. We're caught – the swirling element spins the world around us, faster and faster. The dizzying motion inhibits our ability to think, and we feel like we might fall over at any moment.*

- Each Dreamer on this tile spends **1** `gem` or discards 1 placed Progress card.

# 540
*"And we probably know each other, right?"*

*A second ago, it seemed to us that we were facing our worst enemy, a devil from hell itself – and a moment later, we are happily chatting with it about the rumors we've heard recently.*

You may place this Slumber tile on the Dream Gate slot. When you next enter a Dream or pack up the game, shuffle this Slumber tile into the Slumber deck.

# 541
*Watching the panorama of the distant city brings warm recollections of its streets, lights, and hubbub. The sounds of the metropolis grow around us. We absorb strength from the far-off glow that illuminates the night sky and hides the stars. Reinvigorated by this feeling of power, we realise that we're less and less here and more and more there...*

- Gain **1** `gem`. You may Relocate to the `start` space on the **Bl tile**.

# 542
*Are we allowed in here? We actually feel like intruders... Should we listen to our gut this time?*

*Suddenly, we hear slow, heavy steps – something is approaching. We glimpse a movement somewhere high in the darkness, a hint of long limbs. A towering figure appears at the top of the stairs, casting a long shadow and lighting up the shelves about it with a massive lantern.*

*"From whom have you sought permission to enter? These secrets are not meant for the eyes of most mortals..."*

*And there it is – the guardian of this library.*

- Reveal **tile W** and Spawn the **Librarian**.

- You may **Seal 3 cards** to gain 1`ether`.

*We hear a grim voice: "Who goes there? Stop! Show your papers!"*

- Relocate the **Warden** to this space. Add **1 Morphing**.

# 545
*We find ourselves in a strange, gray city. Desolate buildings covered with cobwebs surround us. Twisted rails jut out of the thick layer of dust – strands of web and rust battle to claim their metallic flesh. We try stomping loudly, to bring some life to this emptiness, but even the sound is dull and the dust settles more quickly than is natural. We turn and realise we have left no footprints behind us.*

*We notice enormous spiders – the only movement anywhere – squatting at the centre of their webs far away, absorbed in whatever hideous task engrosses them. We are fortunate not to be close enough to see their handiwork. We don't feel well here – in fact, quite the opposite. The omnipresent dullness saps our joy and drains our will to achieve anything...*

*Sometimes, when the depression comes, all that's left is to exist. We meander aimlessly among the floating ash as if walking through dense mists – without purpose, without thought of escape to a brighter life. It feels like the longest winter in history. It's the Spiderweb World.*

# 546
If the **"Let's sail!"** card is not revealed, or if the current Turn Suit is not `spades` we turn just so the sails look nice and full in the wind.

- [**Bowline**] -> (874)

# 547
*A sudden flood of recollection stops me mid-walk – for one moment, all the recovered memories overlap and I have the feeling that I understand who I really am and who I was before.*

*However, soon everything fades away again, leaving one last vague, hazy memory: a white room and wires connected to my head. On one side of the bed sits a little boy in a yellow sweater holding a ball; on the other, a tired, old woman sits – she's sleeping soundly. The clock on the wall reads 4:05pm. There is a handful of white pills on the table next to a pot of buckthorn with dead flowers.*

*The strangest thing is that there are two suns in the sky outside the window, one small and yellow, the other large, fading, and red. Where am I? Already... Already here, back. The images fade, and the feeling of strange cosiness – along with the glare from the suns – falls away. But I can't pull myself together for a long time.*

- Gain **1** `ether`.

# 548
*We glide up the wall of water. The situation we find ourselves in is disconcerting, to say the least – we pass fish sticking straight out of the vertical surface, heads basking in the starlight. We could catch some of them and satiate ourselves with their energy. Starlight sashimi is a delicacy few have encountered before.*

- Each Dreamer on this tile may **Seal 3 cards** to cure **1** `damage`.

- Then, Relocate 1 Dreamer from this tile to any other space on the other side of the Wall of this tile.

# 549
*The ocean calms down, the surface becoming as smooth as a millpond. We may rest at last. Then, we discover that it's hard to slide any further without waves – now, we must wait, paradoxically hoping for a storm...*

*After several days, a gust of wind picks up, and we greet it with relief. It is a harbinger of clouds, and soon a storm is pushing us onwards again.*

- Each Dreamer discards **all** `ether`.

- Add **card J (Flood)** to the Fate deck if it's still available.

- Return the Item placed under the Dream Gate tile to the Item Market (the Item you gave to the fisherman in exchange for the Ocean Map).

# 551
*I have always liked mazes and the underground. You too? The underground calls to me from every dark entrance. The tunnels extend under the city indefinitely, I think. And we're here again. This time we came from another direction, but after a while we recognize the corridors of the outer part. Many branches seem too dangerous to examine now – maybe some day. For now, let's find the Heart of the Underground again.*

***Ship's log 07.*** 

*Another half a year has passed. I'm slowly turning into another one of a billion stars. Small, anonymous, extinct, visible in the skies of all the nearest planets. Perhaps even visible from the surface of Earth... from the burned windows of ruined cities – if anyone survived there.*

*I have become an inseparable part of the cosmos as if I have always belonged to it, as if I have been floating in the sky for a million years. Will anyone see me if all the planets and moons that I pass are completely dead? Does anyone else exist anywhere, or will I be alone forever? Irradiated and lonely?*

When you catch it, no one will ever want to deal with you again. You will become invisible, but not in an intriguing sense, more... How shall I put it... Invisible like rubbish. It is difficult to heal afterwards. I don't know why you are wandering around, risking your future. I used to be a teacher... Now look... This is who I am now."*

*The rat-teacher takes out a tattered book from his pocket: 'The Art of Moving Among Rats'.*

*"I could teach you a lot."*

- You may discard **4** `threat` or **Unseal all cards**. If you do, `block` this Map Action afterward.

- If you change your mind now and don't sacrifice this Influence card, suffer **1** `damage` or **Seal 1 card**.

# 560
*A colossal device occupies almost the entire room, looking like an enormous ring or a futuristic
gate. We look through stands holding documents. "Hellgate project: Examination of the other side." The other side... Does that mean – our world?*

*There is more. Synchronicity. Overlapping layers of reality reception. The interpenetration of different states of consciousness. Measuring the ability to influence reality in different states of consciousness. And so on... This is certainly a secret project – a black project.*

*Something shines on the other side of the ring, through it, and the air within it shimmers like summer heat haze off a tarmacked road.*

*The steel rim is connected to the control panel. We see a large, red 'start' button sitting there invitingly.*

- You may **Seal X cards** to **add X Turns**.

*"The tram is rolling - it's all just crap.*

*After a long struggle... the chest pops open. We can't believe our eyes. A skinny and torturously constricted man is in the box. He seems exhausted as he does not react as the crate is prised open. He's folded up like a puppet – all to make him fit into this small wooden crate.*

*Did someone force him in here, or did he do this himself to reach the land of his dreams? If he decided that was his only hope, we can only imagine what he was escaping from.*

*It is better to leave him alone. Maybe he'll get out later by himself. After all, who knows who or what he really is?*

*Or... Maybe we should help him get out right now?* - if yes, gain **1 Flaw** and [resolve] -> (402) But... Are you sure?

If you've taken out the strange figure from the crate during one of your past visits to the Foggy Docks, you immediately close the crate again. Opening it once was quite enough.

*You know that feeling you get when you wake with a start in the middle of the night? When you peer fearfully around your darkened bedroom - the weird chill that creeps up your spine when you see the assortment of clothes draped over a chair turn into something horrible? Trust us - it's more than just an illusion. Darkness is simply the thin barrier between two worlds after all.*

*It's strange, but sometimes we can talk without saying a word. Not with everyone, of course, but this time it worked. We would have said even more about where we came from, how we got here, and where we were going, if only we ourselves were in a position to know. We express our frustration.*

*"Do not worry, it's only natural. Wherever you came from, it was a different time and a different place – I can feel that. When you cross the barrier, you have such an effect on both worlds that your memories get scrambled, partially annulled, and must be recreated again in this new, transformed world. It's no ordinary amnesia – it's known as the Travel effect.*

*"I must move on now, destined to spend but a moment in any one place. There are so many worlds to visit – well, that's the job. But I think we'll meet again."*

*An address pops into our heads. I hope we don't forget it.*

- Gain **card II-34 D (Space Wanderer)**.


# 565
*"You'll never be better than me. I will not permit it. I have my tower, and you have nothing. I shall always soar high above you."*

*As always, for a moment, we hoped that our words would touch this monster, but no. This vortex of darkness, beaks and feathers won't listen to anything – we were naive to think otherwise. Not everything in the world can be made better. Not everything can be repaired or cured. All we succeeded in doing was wasting our time.*

*How many more times are we destined to climb this tower?*

[Resolve] -> (176)


# 566
*We don't know how long we've been wandering, hopelessly lost. At some point the sky flashed – we had already made it to the surface, although still trapped in the endless maze of rooms and passageways. If it wasn't for the bars on the windows, we could have escaped faster. When we finally stumbled across the first people, our spirits lifted immeasurably. At some point, we realised that we had actually arrived in the city without realising it, walking past familiar shops.*

*<u>Failure.</u>*

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 567
*As we approach the rose bush, we discover with unease that whilst some of its blooms are blood red, others are of a colour we cannot put a name to. This indescribable colour conjures up thoughts of a disease or some sort of parasite. What could cause this unnatural hue? And why, despite the horror, is the smell of these flowers still so alluring?*

- You may gain **1 Flaw** to **Unseal all cards**.


# 568
*We perform the rescue manoeuvre smoothly and gently. We pull the man out. He is barely breathing, but we have caught him just in time. Slowly, colour returns to his cheeks and he regains a little vitality. Once we are sure he's improving, we make to leave, but he won't let us go without giving us a gift as thanks. We protest but he won't take no for an answer, and presses something small and shiny into the palm of one of our hands.*

- Gain **1** `gem`.

- Discard the current Turn card.

# 569
*We're silent – we don't listen and we don't answer. The voice fades slowly away. The spinning demon changes and shrinks as the noise abates. Black birds shoot out from it in all directions, leaving one old featherless crow alone on the roof. You can see that it's covered in a patchwork of scars from wounds caused by the claws and beaks of other crows. It was clearly once the alpha, but no longer. It murmurs quietly to itself.*

*"I'm just a crow. Alone. No more murder. I needn't think and feel anymore. Nothing will ever hurt me again. It's better this way..."*

*The pathetic creature disintegrates, turning to dust, and blows away in the wind.*

*It's over, just like that. We are ourselves again, no one has any real power or control over us, it was always just an illusion. And it is, indeed, better this way...*

[Resolve] -> (230)

# 570
*We hear voices coming from the corridor:*

*"The Skylight will never come back. It's gone forever. You have to come to terms with that."*

*"The Skylight is somewhere close, I'm sure of it. Why don't you ever have faith? You never believe in anything."*

*Let's focus on what's in front of us. Someone has blocked the passage with a barricade of broken furniture.
Someone didn't want anyone to get past here. Piece by piece, we pull away the debris, slowly revealing the door. As we are almost finished, something starts to move in the shadows.*

- Reveal **tile X**.

- Reveal **card N** unless it's already revealed.

- If there are *1 or fewer Puppets* in the Dreamscape, **Spawn `player`+l Puppets** (use Shapeshifters).

# 572
*Ho ho, we're doing fine! Just a little longer and we will appear on the main screen – and then the real show will begin...*

*Extra lights are turned on, and today, for the first time, an aircraft with neon advertising flies over the Arena. "Dream holidays on Mars – book now and receive free tunneling lessons in a Drill-car!"*

- Each Dreamer may **Seal 1 card** to cure **1** `damage`.

- Resolve the top card from the **Arena Fate deck** (remember to add 1 Dreamscape Slumber Map tile!).

- If you don't achieve Victory in that Slumber, end your Arena cycle and resolve **Awakening**.

If you end this Slumber with a **Victory**:

- Place 1 `ether` on the Dream Gate tile.

- Then, move the `marker` on the Dream Gate tile to the next slot, following the arrows, and resolve the script displayed in the slot you just reached.

Note: When you are claiming your reward, each Dreamer draws a number of cards from the Influence Market equal to the number of `ether` on the Dream Gate tile. Next, each Dreamer may gain any of these cards – but the total `ether` value of cards gained by a Dreamer cannot exceed the number of `ether` on the Dream Gate tile. Remember, if you lose before claiming your reward – you lose everything.

# 573
*Three beautiful, brand new and shiny dreams – they were worth the hard work! From now on it's no longer our concern – transport, marketing, and all that. We are done for today, as we need to regain our strength before tomorrow. It's going to be another busy day so we need an early night.*

*On the way home, we will stop by the Pipe District. Factory rejects, unsuitable for the main market, may be found there. Who knows, we might be lucky!*

- Gain **tile II-39 R("Shopping in the Pipe District" Dream Gate tile)**.

*<u>Victory.</u>* Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`. Each Dreamer cures **2** `damage` or **Unseals 2 cards**.

# 574
*Suddenly, instead of the deck, we see the sky and clouds beneath our feet. For one brief second, we believe that we can soar, spreading our wings and flying on the wind. Unfortunately, it turns out that we can only fly in one direction. In a moment, we discover how Icarus felt. We have a while to get used to this turn of events as the ground rushes up to meet us, then all goes black.*

*<u>Failure.</u>* Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets.

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream – you can still come back here to try again.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.

- Reveal **tile Y**.

# 576
*It's six o'clock and all is not well.*

- Suffer **1** `damage` and **Seal 1 card**.

# 577
*Finding the Filthy District is easy – this place is calling us, and the only thing we have to do is accept its invitation. If we bear any weight on our shoulders, if we are in pain or grief, the entrance appears almost immediately. We hear a beguiling whisper from the other side, tempting us to enter – but there is no help or respite to be found there.*

*"You don't have to fix anything, just let it go. That's life, my friend. Come to us..."*

# 578
*This is no fairy. It's a TV star, famous in her day but now just a little faded, and she is bathing in her pool. She finally looks at us and says:*

*"I am I. But I don't know you at all. Should I? Who are you? Everyone knows who I am, I have it, you know, that star quality. I visit where it's worth my while, everyone recognises me. And you? Are you someone or nobody? Please, don't waste my time if you're nobody."*

*"We are here because..."*

*"Did you come to clean the pool? Oh, this dirt, dirt everywhere. For years it was calm here, the sun shone, sheep grazed. Unfortunately, since Director Pig opened that Mill and employed crowds of common workers to make mud for him so that he could bathe in it... This place is dying. Someone should set that shrine to materialistic corruption on fire! But if you happen to pass by there, pick some mud up for me, darlings."*

*"Actually, we wanted to..."*

*"I just need a little bit. Just a bit, does my pores the world of good! My people will direct you. Goodbye. Talk to my butler. Jeeves! Goooood-byyyyeeee!"*

- You may discard **1** `gem` to Relocate any Dreamers in this space to any `water` space.

- You may **Spawn 1 Snake** to gain **2** `gem`.

*An old, inconspicuous bicycle. But as soon as we sit on it, our cycling skills become... remarkable. We can jump, do tricks, and even ride up vertical walls!*

- Relocate to **any space** in the Dreamscape.

# 580
*Click. Lights blink around the rim in some incomprehensible sequence and the ring starts rotating slowly accompanied by grinding metallic noises. Something happens... Is time flowing backwards? Or is the room visible on the other side of the ring turning into... This is disturbing and unnatural.*
*The lever is still only in position 1. Maybe we should keep going?*

Do you turn off the device? – *End this script*.

**OR**

Do you pull the lever to the next position? – Place a `block` token on this action, then gain **card J** and reveal **card E**.

# 581
*Several dubious-looking people stand in front of the shop. Their shadows are engaged in a fervent discussion, gesturing vigorously – yet, the people themselves stand still, in silence, looking sadly at the pavement slabs and empty bottles in their hands. We try not to brush past them as we enter the shop.*

**Choose one:**

- Buy new Influence cards.

- Discard `player` `ether` to add **2 Turns**.

- Discard `player` `ether` to discard **2** `damage` from the Dream
Gate tile.

- Each Dreamer **Seals 3 cards** to **add 1 Turn**.

# 582
*Just before the head of the beast plunges into the black depths, we understand that what we heard is the last silent cry of the creature. Maybe it's just expressing hunger and rage, or maybe it's something more. It is of no consequence now.*

[Resolve] -> (309)

# 583
*Shaken students huddle in the car park and in front of the school entrance. Exams are being held today, and nobody remembered – everyone pushed all thought of exams to the back of their minds, as did we. We even forgot that we were still at school. We haven't been here for almost a year, but today is the most important day. We must figure out what to do, or it's all over...*

**Choose one:**

- *We flee. At least today, we will be free. We will deal with the consequences tomorrow* – gain **1** `gem`

- *Let's try to cram all these subjects quickly. Who can lend us some useful notes?* – place 2 Businesses in any spaces with any Turn Suit symbol
(max 1 Business per space) and [resolve] -> (491)

# 584
*It must be THIS apartment – green, intricately decorated wallpaper... And everything else is correct. Or, almost everything.*

*A large, pale, ghostly figure with a bird's head squats on the pile of broken furniture. Thin hands protrude from under the black coat, ending in claws. The creature plays with puppets, their strings hanging from each claw. They look disturbingly familiar. A shiver runs down our spines, and we involuntarily look up to check if there are lines hanging from the ceiling guiding our limbs, like involuntary marionettes. Phew, fortunately, we don't see anything like that... Although does that mean they're not there?*

*The creature turns its avian head towards us.*

*"You are late, she doesn't live here anymore. But I think I could help you. I'm just not sure whether I want to."*

You may end this script now.

**OR**

Resolve the following:

*"For a thousand years, peace and prosperity prevailed in this land. But one day..." The old bird begins its story.*

*"Look, we REALLY don't have time for this crap."*

*"Well, ok. But maybe you have some money? I'll trade you something for coin, I'm not a beggar."*

*The bird pulls out a large watch on a chain, turns the knob, and our shadows move right and left, as does the blurred stain of the setting sun behind the curtain of toxic fumes.*

*"I trade in extra time. Time is the most sought-after commodity in the city, so – do you need some? Need time? Just a minute? A second perhaps?"*

- You may spend **1** `marker` to **add 5 Turns**.

# 588
*The beast opens her eyes - we can only see insatiable, wild hunger in them... We prefer even not to think about what she could have been dreaming of.*

- Reveal **tile Y**.

- There are **2 Entity tiles** in Dream now, but there's only 1 Dream Entity slot - in this case, place the second Entity tile next to the Dream Gate tile or any place near the board. When you resolve effects from both Entity tiles, you may choose in which order you resolve them.

# 589
*Gray stones roll across the floor, as our tired feet kick them. We should stop for a moment and collect them, fill our pockets – each of them will become whatever we want in this world of illusion.*

*But they are everywhere, so let's not waste too much time collecting them...*

- You may discard **1 Turn** to gain **all** available `gem`.

# 590
*Yikes, I trip over something and almost fall into a damned hole! What moron has left it open? And the cover lies just next to it. Wait... Did I just lose something down there?*

- If this is a `night` space, spend **3** `green` or discard **1 active Item**.

*And maybe you want to risk descending into the hole?* - [if you do] -> (240)

# 591
*We reach out to grab the creature and feel its nasty, freezing touch. Pulling it out takes much effort but, eventually, we drag the hideous human out of the heap and it limps towards the door. It turns back to us. "Thank you. I won't be greedy anymore. Never." Then, it leaves, melting into the darkness.*

*We sit down and take a short break.*

**Add 1 Turn**.

# 592
*We try to look intimidating, like a butterfly that spreads its wings covered in colourful but menacing eyespot patterns. Maybe we could cross this street without running into trouble... Maybe all those scary people will believe that they'd better not mess with us?*

- If there's `threat` in *range 1*, gain **1 Flaw**.

- You may place **1** `threat` on each space of this tile to Block the punishing rule on the Green Neighborhood card (use `block` token) until the end of this Dream.

# 593
*"Give it to me! I'm so hungry I'd eat anything."*

Are you sure? You may remove this card from the game – then, each Dreamer ***Reminds*** twice, and after that, move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

If you change your mind now and don't sacrifice this, suffer **1** `damage` or **Seal 1 card**.

# 594
*That's how it ends when you don't take people seriously. Everyone has an internal fuse that, once triggered, will say: "Enough!" Shaking with rage, tired hands tear the machine apart, smashing delicate work, trampling ingredients instead of producing beautiful dreams. Enough! Enough! Enough!*

- Add **card C** to the **Flaw deck** and [resolve] -> (157)

- Relocate to any crate on **C3**.

# 597
You may end this Dream immediately if you want:

*A still mannequin lies behind the police tape.*

*"Did anyone die here?" we ask a kind-looking policewoman.*

*"Yes, that poor lad, as you can see. We can't investigate this case any further, as we lost the chalk. We can't outline the corpse, you know? And... Who are you? Detectives?"*

*We don't know what to answer. Maybe it's better to go with the flow?*

*"Oh yes, we're here for this case, For the case of the missing chalk, of course. We have our leads – but we need a pass from you to look around the harbour and the warehouse."*

*Or maybe more honestly, less directly?*

*"Well, not really, but we think we can help... As they say, the law could use all hands on deck."*

*Anyway, we manage to lead the conversation in such a way that it reaches the same point. After all, we have the advantage over them that we know we're dreaming. And that makes it a lot easier.*

*"Sure, you'll get your pass. But I have to check your leads. You know how it works. For now, the case is suspended, and I'll stand guard here for many sleepless nights."– she ends with a long yawn.*

- Gain **card II-34 R (Case Suspended)**.

*Something has gone wrong...*

*Everything in the world is devoid of its colour and its contrast; like a gray, impenetrable fog.*

*I need something new, and quickly, to kill this emptiness inside.*

- Return **1 Active Item** to the **Item Market** or suffer **1** `damage`.

# 605
*Finally! Up there, among so many unnecessary and harmful souvenirs, these are the few that gives us strength. It wasn't easy searching this dump.*

If the **Locker** is in this space, you may add **1 Morphing** to gain **6** `gem` (if you do that, place a `block` token on this action).

Finally, you may **Move the Locker 2 spaces** or **Relocate the Lamp to any tile**.

# 606
You added 6 people to 600 kgs, right? And the result was 606? *Good job, Detective Clouseau...*

Try not to meddle too much by adding random things, because you may end up in scripts you shouldn't be reading. 

While it's impossible to predict every scenario, and you may have spotted a visible pattern or a clue and you're sure that you should check something, try it - but if you end up on a random script, quickly stop reading it! Surely you don't want any spoilers, right?

That's it. There's nothing more in this script. But you've used a bit of lateral thinking and learned something, so you should be rewarded for this! **Each Dreamer** gains **1** `ether`. This is a valuable resource that represents your Dreamers' experience and can be used for a variety of things, explained later on. 

This will only happen **once**. Reading this script a second time has no effect.

# 607
*Our bodies remain below, while we soar higher and higher, piercing the clouds to reach the darkness among the stars.*

*We are not alone here...*

*Countless ranks of strange beings hover around the planet - a really weird crowd. We see ethereal places drifting in the void - beach houses glowing in the dark, marble palaces, museums, schools, all inhabited by ethereal beings. Confusion reigns supreme.*

*Impatient ghosts stand in lines that stretch around the planet, with new ones arriving from afar, while others leave to fly into interstellar space. Sometimes these ghosts move aside, letting a sniffing beast or an electric cloud pass. Guards patrol through the crowd to maintain order. An uncanny-looking ship hangs in orbit. Grotesque creatures mass at its windows, staring hungrily out at the blue globe.*

*We hear a question, probably directed at us:*

*"So, are you going back there?"*

*"Yup, I still have some work left to do."*

- If you decide to play on, without packing up the game, you do not have to discard your Progress cards. But if you decide to end your game session now, you must still discard them in the usual way.

# 608
*"I've got you! Caught red-handed!"*

*"But, we didn't do anything..."*

*"Nothing? What's this, then?" The Warden interjects, showing us a small plastic bag taken out of his pocket. "And this?" a toy knife joins the sachet. "And also...this?!" He plucks several hairs from our heads and drops them into a container labelled "Evidence."*

*He smiles with a hint of pity.*

*"You won't get away. We were looking for you for three, you hear, three months. And now, progress at last! Show me your wrists."*

*He was right. We really didn't get away with it. Just like in every good courthouse drama, the best parts were played by the main actors, the best participants in this scene - the Defender and the Prosecutor. They were having fun, reciting all the lines they'd rehearsed. The winner gained a trophy, the loser just shrugged. The evidence is overwhelming, and we should receive an "appropriate" sentence, according to the Judge, who looks tired and disinterested. With a bang of his gavel, we are swiftly transported out of the courtroom.*

*"Where are we going?" we ask the question, nervously, to one of the Prison Guards escorting us.*

*"You will like it there. Best prison in Pandemonium." he smiles, wryly, flashing a set of golden teeth nestled in his chubby face. "Oh, and the Warden's great too."*
 
- Relocate the Team to the **Prison Location** on the **Pandemonium Dreamworld Map**.

- You may suffer **1** `damage` to gain **3**`gem`.

# 610
Remove this **Train card** from the game.

*The train departs, leaving us behind. We feel better even as we watch it travel further away until it disappears in the far-off distance. For the meantime, we will no longer be disturbed by the gloomy and sad reflections of its passengers. We have enough of our own problems.*

*In this part of the park lies a lot of rubbish, and cobwebs obstruct the path.*

*"So, what are you staring at?" The dirty head turns away, losing interest in us.*

*"Oh no, nothing... Sorry, but what is this..."*

*"I have no time for this, I am working!" he interrupts sharply. "Take a look around instead. Just go left, left, right, left or whatever and you will definitely find the path. Give me a break."*

*We feel smaller and smaller with each gruff word from this grim man. Like children who have been shouted at just because they are children.*

- Reveal **card C**.

*We may take the advantage of our smaller stature and peek into one of the dens.*

- You may discard **1**`gem` to [resolve] -> (634).

# 614
*We try reaching the sky, riding the highest wave we can find. We are so close to the firmament, a little closer and we could touch it. But just then the wave breaks, and we tumble away from our goal onto the ocean surface.*

# 615
*Hurry, hurry!!! We have to run to school! It is VERY important!*

Then, [resolve] -> (076).

# 618

- Gain **card K (Mysteries Wisdom card)**.

*We rifle through the pages and find a map - with a particular building marked. We think it's worth taking a look there.*

*And there's one more thing! A small, blue device. It's plain except for a small button and a label: "Delta Phase Regulator."*

*And he returns to work.* 

But you can buy some valuable resources on the side when nobody is watching. You may discard **1** `ether` / **1 Key** or return **1 active Item** to the Item Market to gain **card E (Mud)**.

# 620
*We are standing on the edge of a large gap in the floor - peering over, we have a nice view of the lower floors. We are slowly beginning to grasp the layout of this building.*

- If there are no more than 2 Floor cards placed on the Dreamscape, you may spend **3** `gem` to place **1 chosen Floor** and then `block` this action.


# 621
*We're waiting in the queue to the park's entrance. They're only admitting four people at a time, so one of us will have to wait a while longer.*

- There is only 1 `start` space in this Dream, so only 4 Dreamers can be there at the same time. The 5th Dreamer may appear in the Dream at any moment during the Dreamers Phase when there are 3 or fewer Dreamers in the `start` space. Despite this, the fifth player resolves the Draw step in the normal way.

# 622

*The wind becomes so violent that the bottom of our sail tears.*

- [**Abandon** the ship!] -> (451).

- [**Blow** into the sail] -> (908).

# 624
*"Sweet candy - I shouldn't eat so much, but I just can't resist it." a big smile appears on the hideous face.*

- Return this `gem` to the pool to ***Remind*** once, then move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

# 625
***Ship's log 08***.

*We know very little about space. I saw my first wonders three months ago. Rainbows of shadows and sadness disconnecting from objects so dark that they were undetectable by radars and sensors. But I know they are there. I sense and almost see them.*

*More and more anomalies occur every day. We imagined the distant cosmos differently based on photos, spectrum analyses, samples, and theories adopted. However, my body sometimes refuses to obey, the radiation is merciless.*

*We are like children drifting on the ocean, our technology is not advanced enough for such a flight, and there's no return ticket either. My life is racing towards the finish line. Cosmic rays penetrate the ship's shields easily. I don't have the slightest chance of survival.*

*I'm pretty sure I saw souls hovering outside the ship three days ago...*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`.

- Gain **1 Key**.

- Cross out the number on the **"Reading the Ship's log"** and write a new one: **"849"**.

# 626
*We didn't expect so much luxury in such a place - marble stairs, a gilded banister, walls adorned with golden ornaments and frescoes, and under the high, intricately-painted ceiling with intricate paintings, hundreds of well-dressed guests abandoned themselves in countless games. Vampires, humanoid animals clad in precious furs, gloomy officials, aristocrats - all of them focus on tiny balls, spinning roulette wheels, the cards flowing between croupiers' hands, or pull on the machine levers again and again. A cacophony of addictive squeaks, bells, and artificial melodies saturates the air.*

- **Seal / Flip 3 Progress cards.**

You may bet **X** `ether` and roll the **Luck die**:

`luck-x` = Suffer **1** `damage` and lose **all** bet `ether`.

`luck-blank` = Lose **all** bet `ether`.

`luck-1` = Regain **all** bet `ether`.

`luck-2` = Regain **all** bet `ether` and gain **1 additional** `ether`.

`luck-3` = Regain **all** bet `ether` and gain **X additional** `ether`, then `block` this Map Action.

Beware, for each Reroll you make in the casino, you suffer 1 `damage` - *"No one cheats in our casino!"*


# 627

- [Intimidation] -> (1184)

- [Deception] -> (1105)

- [Understand] -> (1044)

- [Open yourself] -> (1083)

# 629
*In this case, the Cathedral is just a name for a gigantic pile of buildings. Strangely enough, there is also a real cathedral here, but only those who have lost all faith visit it. Thousands of shops, restaurants, cinemas, and other entertainment outlets are much more prevalent here - it is a real maze of pleasure, colourful and beautiful, where you can abandon yourself, spend your whole life, and never become bored.*

**Choose one:**

- [Buy something special - spend **3** `gem` to resolve] -> (075).

- [Have fun] -> (301).

- [Look for rare entertainment] -> (352).

# 630
*Twisted buildings bend at unnatural angles, making us feel dizzy, and the blood starts rushing through our veins. For a moment, we forget about past mistakes and are focused on the here and now - overwhelmed by fear. At the edge of the dim light, we see sinister shadows. We'd better be wary...*

# 632
***Chapter II: Disaster***

*Something even worse happens. Piece by piece, all the equipment explodes, the fire spreads quickly. Lights flash like crazy. After a while, the fire protection system turns on, and artificial rain pours down over everything. After a while, all that is left is acrid smoke that searches for vents to escape.*

*The steel wall of Zone B3 rises, sealing the room with armoured glass...*

- Flip **tile Z (Zone B3)** face-up.

*Behind the glass, we see several nightmarish figures. The glass will break soon...*

- Place 1 `block` on the door on **B3 tile** - it's *closed*. When the door is *closed*, the edge of the space they are on is treated as **Wall**.

- Reveal **tile W (Altered)** and Spawn **2 Altered** on **B3**.

*Something bad is starting to happen to the volunteer...*

From now on, **the Volunteer** becomes another **Altered**.

- **Flip tile Al** and place **all** Dreamers on `start` spaces.

- Reveal **card B.**

# 634
*The tunnel twists and bends and seems without end. We suddenly realise that it is no longer a common earth-filled den and we are now surrounded by a paved,
 chequered black and white floor and blue walls. It keeps getting narrower, though. We cannot go further, unless...*

- You may discard 1 `gem` to [resolve] -> (438).

# 635
*This is a bizarre character. Long arms, hands sweeping the ground, and large, glowing eyes under his shaded hood. Certainly, the figure came from somewhere far away and now intends to go further.*

*"You also have a long way behind you," he says, as if reading our minds.*

- [Ask about the **trains**] -> (338).

- [Talk to the **stranger**] -> (564).

# 636
*The older man raises his cane and hits the ground three times. Then the sand and shells part, revealing an ancient seabed full of stones, dead or still-living fish which can't escape. And there are also twinkling stars. It's a hidden part of the sky.*

- Gain **card F (Ursa Major)**.

- Return the **2 cards forming the mysterious island** to the Secrets of this Dream and discard all Ocean Map tiles. 

- Then, draw 1 random **Ocean tile** and place it anywhere in the Dreamscape. 

- Finally, place all Dreamers in any spaces of that tile.

# 637
*We turn to look at the ship for the last time and realize that the hull is in the shape of a casket. A terrifying grinding noise echoes through the air and a massive crack opens up under the ship, dragging it into an abyss. Eventually the only evidence it was ever there is... A key. Wait, it's not just any 'key', it's a **Silver Key**! Such a key opens the way to much deeper layers of dreams where our true mission lies.*

*We find ourselves standing in the middle of the rusty ocean of mud. Alone. The strangest thing, it turns out after a while, is that all this ocean of blood is just a big puddle on the solid floor of an old, abandoned house. We are back.*

*<u>Victory.</u>* Each Dreamer cures `damage` or **Unseals 3 cards**.

- Gain **card F (The 1st Silver Key)**.

- Add **tile II-36 G** to the Slumber Map deck.

- Restore 3 Shopping cards (**II-41 C**).

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.

# 638
*Let's look at this dream...* 

*We're all vampires. We are sitting around a big, carved table in a huge gothic-styled dining room. The first course is served to us by sombre shadows - canapes of fear, sorrow, and doubt, and red wine served in diamond goblets. They only stimulate the appetite for more. Finally, we hear slow steps, and the curtain opens... Oh, yes! Pain, the tastiest dish of all!*

*But no one was forced to do anything. It was their own choice - they could have chosen any of us. Each human can choose their own vampire, it is a free country after all.*

*Rating: Disturbing, scary, but wonderful. Everyone likes vampires, everyone wants to be one of them! This dream will sell for sure.*

- Place **1 Story token** on the Dream Gate tile.

- Each Dreamer may place *any* number of Progress cards from their hand or Discard pile for *free* (the limit of Progress cards still applies) **OR** Buy new cards now.

- If the **Union Leader** is not revealed, [resolve] -> (330).

# 639
*We tumble into the whirlpool, but a strange, mighty power halts our fall and tosses us high into the sky, far above the churning ocean. We notice a huge wave to the east and an observatory hidden behind its sturdy wall.*

# 640
*We meet a black cat on the marble stairs and chat with it a little.*

*It comes from the City of Cats, which it points towards vaguely using its front paw in between washing itself and looking down its nose at us. We don't quite understand whether it means the city is somewhere nearby or on one of the stars in the sky. We could ask the cat for a hint as to our intended path, but of course... nothing is free.*

- You may discard **1** `gem` or **Seal 5 cards** to reveal **card B**.

# 641
*Time passes differently in the world of thought. Thoughts can slow down or accelerate to unimaginable speeds. It is not time that is the obstacle here.*

*You should realise by now that not all photographs can be put together. These are events that never happened. They are flights of fantasies and unrealised plans that, no matter how beautiful they are, are not real. Even if you spend all eternity trying to put them together, you won't succeed.*

*We hope you didn't lose too much time. But then again, time is not the problem in this case.*

- Reshuffle all 12 Turn cards and make a **new Turn deck** from them.

# 642
*Oh, it wasn't easy. The swamp refuses to abandon its victims without a fight. In the end, however, we won this time.*

*The huntress hands us her business card.*

*"Be sure to visit me when you are in Metropolis. Maybe I can get you out of some of your swamps. In the meantime I have to run, my train will arrive in fifteen minutes. Thank you again!"*

- Gain **card II-34 E (Huntress Note card)**.

# 643
*The mechanism grinds loudly, and specks of rust are flicked everywhere.*

*The floor shakes slightly. Does it even work?*

- If the **Water! card** isn't revealed yet, you won't achieve anything here.

- [However if the **Water! card** is revealed go to] -> (152).

# 644
*"Oh, it's you!" - the robber exclaims, fiddling with large engine gears using his enormous mechanical hand. His companion, a strange, clumsy figure in a big hat pulls one of the levers so hard that his cheeks grow red with exertion. We know these travellers from somewhere...*

*"Come on, help us get rid of these walls! It's difficult to move around here at all because of them and I don't know about you, but we are in a hurry. On the count of three... One... Two... Three!"*

- Each Dreamer may suffer **1** `damage`. If you decide to do this, mark this slot with a `marker` - you may **ignore Walls** during this Dream.

*"Thanks for the help! It's time for us to leave... Good luck!"*

# 645
*What we found in the boxes is hard to describe in words. But we will not forget it for a long time.*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.

*Remember*: Whenever you run out of `block` tokens during this Dream and you have to place one, take the `block` token from the furthest space from your Dreamer.

# 647
*"Food is the real key to our gratitude."*

- Return this **Key** to the pool - then each Dreamer ***Reminds twice***. Move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint afterward.

# 648
The authorities always draw their strength from the people they are sworn to serve. These forces sometimes forget this and lose their true purpose, instead relying on fear and tyranny to keep the people in line. Restoring the former state is no easy task, but this time, we prevailed.

- Return this Slumber tile to the Secrets.

- Add **tile II-37 Q (Warden)** to the Slumber deck.

# 649
*Darkness finally enshrouds and devours us. There is a lack of air, a lack of light, a lack of energy to bring up even one final thought. All is emptiness - the absence of everything...*

- Change the Season to **Season of Secret Paths**.

- Each Dreamer gains **1 Flaw**.

[There's nothing left... Resolve] -> (768).

# 650
*Dream Factory is proud to be a part of a larger business family that, at its heart, strives to help the world function better. We are proud to say that we recognise the role we have to play in everyone's daily lives and we embrace that role whole-heartedly.*

*Dream Factory: Better Dreams Every Night!*

*Or just leave them alone.*

# 652
*"Some crumbs... And where is the rest of this dish?"*

- Discard your active Mask to ***Remind*** once, then Move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

If you don't have an Active Mask, *nothing happens*.

# 653
*The yellow door – do we really want to go in there?*

Look at the whole Dreamscape and think about where it could possibly lead. What do these colors mean?

[If you're sure that you want to go in] -> (279)

*If you don't want to - just don't do it.*

# 654
*At the last moment, right before the last shadow perished under the sun rays, our protege flees – his breath is shallow, his heart broken to pieces. What will be his life's work now when everything in his eyes has lost purpose? In the end though, things are apparently not so bad – a few words and signatures later and he feels needed once again. A great cause awaits him.*

- Discard the current Dreamscape (**card A** and **tiles B2 and B3**).

- Each Dreamer draws influence cards so they have 4 of them in their hand.

You've revealed the **Chapter II card** – it is now active.

# 655
*Ouch! Well... I knew it was risky to handle something like this.*

- Suffer **1** `damage`, and you are **Paralyzed**.

![Paralyze](/assets/images/secrets/paralyze.png "Paralyze")


# 656

If there are ***3 or more***, discard the Wound token.

# 657
*Eventually, we reach the end of the gang territory, and we move on towards a better place. Or so we hope.*

If there's `threat` in *range 1*, Flip **2** Progress cards.

Relocate to any `start` space. You may reveal any 1 unrevealed Map tile in the same row or column and place your Dreamer in the `start` of that tile.

# 658
*We have been crossing these endless swamps for days. Mosquitoes torment us constantly and the ground bubbles with every step, releasing fumes that carry the stench of rotting earth. When the fog thins at last, we see many lights twinkling in the distance.*

*This is the Glass Sea, made of glass, of course. As it moves with the tides, it cracks, forming high waves of mashed shards and mud, glitteringly beautiful but deadly sharp. A high tower stands in the middle of the sea, its top adorned with a moored balloon swaying in the wind. The tower seems to be sinking slowly into the muddy water.*

*Thousands of screeching voices carry to us from afar. A dark cloud of crows surrounds the tower, then the stream of black birds scatters before turning in our direction...*

*We thread our way between the sparkling blades as fast as we can, burning our last residues of strength and determination. How will we get to the top?*

- Each Dreamer **Flips 1 Progress card** or suffers **1** `damage`.

# 659
Do you meet the specific conditions from the Train card (if there are any)? If yes, read on.

*To travel is to wait – that's when time begins to make fun of us. The steady clackety-clack of the rails seems to slow down, the images outside the window move more lazily, almost as if we are taking a stroll. As usual, sleep comes to the rescue. A dream within a dream...*

*<u>Victory.</u>* Retrieve **all** stolen Item cards (if there were any).

- Relocate the Team marker to any Location on the Dreamworld Map tiles listed on the Train card.

- Restore 3 Shopping cards (II-41 C).

throw a life raft overboard. Yet, we fail to change our course. When we look around, we cannot see the poor soul anymore.*

- Don't discard the current Turn card.

# 661
*Those pretty thick bushes are our "base". Sparrows live here, but they aren't at home at the moment. Nobody will find me here.*

- Place your **Personal token** in this space.

- Whenever you suffer `damage` and you are in this space, you may discard your Personal token from this space to prevent **1** `damage`.

# 662
*Day never dawns here, night lasts forever. The other characters slowly crawl away, scattering without saying a word. We are still waiting, trying to understand where we are, and why. From time to time, the building's door closes again and then opens, pouring out green water full of bodies. We don't want to wait here any longer...*

- Remove **1** `gem` from the game or each Dreamer gains **1 Flaw**.

[Resolve] -> (111)

# 663
*We read the text, looking over our shoulders nervously. At one point, we stop at a description of a sunny landscape. However, at the same time, we can still hear the rain in the dark outside the window. The image conjured up by the paragraphs blends with our surroundings, and soon we see the scene it describes, but overrun by the shadows of the night. Heavy raindrops crush fields of grain, the path turns into a rushing torrent of mud. There is also a thatched cottage. We hope it's dry in there...*

- Reveal **card G**.

# 664
*"Don't mind me, I don't exist," the girl says, brushing her braids away. We try speaking with her, but she ignores us.*

– [*Okay, don't be afraid, we will leave you alone...*] -> (413)

– [*Nobody else heard you. You may not have called to us out loud, but we can still hear you...*] -> (803)

*The ventilation ducts would easily accommodate an adult human. Or something not human but just as big...*

- Reveal **card B**.

# 669
*"Thank you, thank you very much."*

*The beggar immediately eats the money we've donated.*

*"I would like to drink something now. Like they say, I'm like a bottomless pit – I have to eat and drink every single day – would you believe that? Well... I wonder, where is all this milk and honey which they talk about? I've looked in every corner and I still haven't found anything. But you probably have better eyes than mine."*

# 675
*Home at last! Twelfth floor, the door on the left. Wait... Something's wrong here. The door is different...*

*A strange figure emerges from the door, the door that should be ours. It's extremely thin, like an insect, and very tall.*

*Oh, it's not the twelfth... It's the eleventh.*

*...And the floor above is the thirteenth? Where did the twelfth floor go? Where is my flat???*

- You may gain **3** `gem`.

**OR**

- You may spend 1 `gem` to add **card I (Home Sweet Home)** to the **Fate deck**.


# 677

This Slumber ends.

- Return this Slumber tile to the Secrets.

- Add **tile II-38 T (Rabid Pearl Hunter)** to the Slumber deck.


# 679

**Hint 1**: The mixed-up letters have to make one word. Start from here. Ignore the blocks with numbers for now. What is the word?

If you have the word and still don't know what to do, remember that you can buy the second hint.



# 684
*A group of suspicious characters sit in front of the hut. Dirty, skinny – don't they have any work to do? They look at each other at the sight of us. One of them spits on the ground.*

- You can Relocate to a **Vent space** on **A2**.

# 688
*Dry land! We finally spy the shore!*

*We rest in a filthy tavern – but after the long and exhausting journey, a hard, crude chair is as comfortable as a soft bed, and a cup of water with
a piece of bread makes a lavish banquet. We see other people's faces – and we find that we pined for other people so much. We rediscover that everything we have and everything surrounding us is so precious, so wonderful!*

*The tavern bustles with patrons – their forks stab tasty delicacies, but their faces twist in disgust after each bite. They smell their mugs, wrinkle their noses, and put their drinks aside. The waiters and the bartender are barraged continuously with complaints: "What's this? I won't even touch it, it's a scandal! Awful, I want something else!"*

*We look at the cup standing on our table – it's so alluring and beautiful. We are sure that nobody notices what we see – it's ordinary wood, but to us it sparkles like pure silver.*

*But we've got some unusual weeds in our hands.*

- **Draw 2 influence cards**.


# 693
If the card **"Let's sail!"** is *not* revealed, or if the current Turn Suit is *not* `spades`, you climb up the mast – you succeed, and you manage to change the position of the sail. It's still an achievement. Gain **1** `gem`.

If the card **"Let's sail!"** is revealed and the current Turn Suit is `spades`, resolve the following:

- *The backstay snaps violently.*

- [Change course to the wind line] -> (738)

- [Try to sail with the wind] -> (992)

- [Set the ship sideways to the wind] -> (839)


# 694
*Through the clear windows, we see people sitting in satin armchairs – all of them hidden in deep shadows. Only their hands, holding crystal chalices filled with red wine, are visible. Sometimes, one of the figures stands up, but before we can see their face, they turn into mist, a pack of rats, or a cloud of bats.

"This is a vampire-only bar. Are you one of us?" – a bouncer asks.*

[If you have an **active Vampire Progress** card] -> (462)

If *not*, you are not admitted into the bar.

Additionally, you may suffer **1** `damage` to gain **1 Story token**.

# 695
*We cannot perceive the passage of time – we focus only on ourselves. Months, years, decades... It doesn't matter, as we are insignificant to the world. It's not that easy to leave this place. It won't let you escape!*

Reshuffle the 12 Turn cards and make a **new Turn deck**.


# 696
*The entire district is flooded. Boats and even larger ships float between the tenement houses, carrying residents. Fishing rods hang from almost every window. There are deckchairs on the roof of a low building sticking out just above the water, like on a seaside beach.*

*Well, when I next see a boring old puddle, I don't think I'll call it a flood again.*

You may find and remove the **Flood card** from the **Fate deck** (if it's already in the game) **OR** Settle any 1 Business from any spaces.


# 697
*Suddenly, lightning strikes the water near us, and we see a huge, clawed hand hiding in the clouds from the corner of our eyes. Something shiny floats where the lightning struck – it must be a newborn star.*

- Spend **1** `gem` or suffer **1** `damage`.

- If you have any **Constellation cards**, place **1** `marker` on any of them.

If you want to continue searching the area being speared with bolts of lightning, you may [resolve] -> (256)


# 698
*Wednesday, 7am, time for school. Breakfast and notebooks in the backpack, baseball cap on head – off we go.*

*The city is already awake, and the sun warms the streets. Grandma Abby sits on her bench and feeds the pigeons, as usual. A beautiful, white airship sails the clear sky.*


# 699
*The age-old clock, the third great owner of this house, measures each smallest fragment of life, ticking an announcement of its passing.*

If **the Lamp and the Locker are both on B2**, resolve:

- You may **discard 2 Turns** and **Seal 5 cards** to gain **card M** (Eternal Riddle).


# 700
*The table is equipped with steel manacles – presumably in case the research subject has something against being examined. There is also a microscope and a whole range of analytical devices. If only there were something to examine...*

You may **Seal 1 card** to gain **2** `gem`.

# 701
*The garage is incredibly vast. Instead of lamps, light streams in through rows of colourful skylights. Peering through one of them, we glimpse
a fragment of the maze that we have not yet seen.*

- Reveal **card D**.

*A beautiful blue car stands on a large rotating pedestal. It's for sale...*

- If this is the **Old Dream**, you may discard **2** `ether` to gain **card H (Blue car)**.

# 702
*Hidden between some fragments of rubble there is an entrance to the dug-out tunnel. I just have to squeeze through and... I'm inside.*

- Reveal **card C**.

# 703
*We inhale the fresh aroma of the green fields and experience a sense of release we've not felt for a very long while. We can finally be our true selves here – casting aside the face we portray to the world in our daily lives for the first time in ages.*

- You may return *any* one of your **Masks** to the **Mask pool** (and return its card back to the Secrets) to **draw 3 cards** from the **Influence Market** and gain **l** of them for free.

# 704
*We perform a rescue manoeuvre – it all goes like clockwork, each person playing their part, as if we'd been doing this all our lives. The rescued man, dripping water onto the deck and getting his breath back, can hardly find the words to thank us. He promises to help us out on the ship and, in return for saving his life, insists on giving us one of his treasures.*

- Gain **1 Key**.

- Discard the **current Turn card**.

# 706
*This is definitely bigger than even the largest swimming pool we could ever imagine. A colossal amphitheatre surrounds the first, separate shallow section but behind the other submerged barriers, even vaster and deeper areas open up. Swarms of people swim between ships and the water is teeming with fish, plants, and strange creatures of the deep. The weirdest thing is that as soon as we are in the water it feels as though we become a part of this aquatic ecosystem and have belonged here forever. Floating effortlessly, we take a tentative taste of the water and find that it's salty.*

*We soon discover that swimming is also just as easy and soon we're reaching unbelievable speeds, out limbs moving like human jet skis. Just a few smooth kicks and paddles take us a mile away from where we were. We start to explore the unusual seabed. It turns out that bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny sea is very relaxing indeed.*

- Each Dreamer **Unseals 6 cards** and **cures 2** `damage`.

# 707
*It's true that the whirlpools of the far north are especially dangerous. The ocean plays with us as if we were a golf ball, trying to score a point for putting us roughly into the hole.*

- Each Dreamer on this tile spends **1** `gem` or discards **1 placed Progress card**.

# 708
*Pitchers full of water and bags of soil lie all around. Common, everyday ingredients – worthless in their current state, until they are turned into valuable, glorious mud - with the help of some elbow grease.*

*The heart of the Mill radiates light and energy, but it beats unevenly. It is sick, that's for sure.*

- **Draw 2 influence cards**.

# 710
*In the wet wall, between the crumbling tiles, a deep hole gapes. There is something in there. It's hard to reach, but maybe it's worth making the effort...*

- You may **Restore 1 Item**.

# 711
*Another risky leap into the dark – it gives me the creeps every time.*

How much `yellow` did you spend?

- **1-2** – Resolve ***Cold Bath***.

- **3 or more** – Reveal **tile X** if it is not revealed, then Relocate to **C4**, either to the space with the crate or to the one with the lifebuoy.

*We ponder whether it's always the best plan to jump as far as possible. After all, we could miss something valuable that had been closer to us.*

# 712
**Ship's log 13**. 

*Another month has passed. And another one. And one more year. And another... Aeons have passed, too numerous to count. The destination that has patiently awaited me at the end of my journey finally looms into view...*

*The coordinates are accurate – I can see the familiar arrangement of stars and the Sun. But what appears on the screen and radar...*

*That cannot be true.*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`.

- Gain **1 Hour**.

- Cross out the number on the **"Reading the Ship's log"** and write a new one: **"824"**.

# 713
*It's nine o'clock. There is nothing here but a cold and empty darkness...*

- Suffer **1** `damage` and **Seal 1 card**.

# 715
*The Tormentor drifts away – and we are able to turn back to our lost planet.*

*The journey lasts forever, during which the little energy that remained in our bodies deserts us, and everything goes dark. When we regain consciousness, we are lying on a strange platform, our saucer lying a little way from us. This place looks like a farm... or maybe a factory?*

*However, when we look around more, a shocking truth comes to us – we are on a huge table – and we are a part of the feast that is currently underway. Giants sit all about us, and their meaty hands reach over our heads for another dish.*

- If there's **0** `marker` on the Entity tile, [this Dream ends] -> (006)

Otherwise, each Dreamer sets aside:

- a number of cards in their hand equal to the number of `marker` on the Entity tile,

- a number of cards from the top of their Influence deck equal to the number of `marker` on the Entity tile (if you don't have enough cards in your deck to do that, take the missing cards from the top of your Discard pile).

After that, each Dreamer Seals all their cards (from hand, deck and Discard pile) ***except*** their **set-aside cards** and their **placed Progress cards**. Each Dreamer creates their new Influence deck from the set-aside cards.

You cannot use anything (any special actions, cards, etc.) to increase the number of cards you keep during the resolution of this script. If you had any Flaw cards, you must put them in your deck.

In this Dream, the rule that causes the instant death of any Dreamer with fewer than 6 cards in their deck is ***ignored***.

- Now, discard the **Setup tile** and ***Tile X (Tormentor)***.

- Reveal the 4 **tiles Y** (and place Dreamers in `start` spaces).

- Reveal **card A**.

- Reveal **card B**, in such a way that the **Checkpoint of tile A2** connects with the ***red symbol*** on the Bowl card.

# 716
*The rays of the sun shine out of the photo and warm our cold skin.*

- You may **Seal 3 cards** to cure **1** `damage`.

*A terifying portrait of an ancestor hangs next to it. Either the painter was prodigiously inept, or the man was a monster in human skin – the picture is so ancient that nobody knows the truth anymore. Suddenly, a movement! The creature from the portrait lunges out at us, his clawed hands draw us to him in a morbid embrace.*

- Spend **1** `gem` or **Seal 1 card**.

# 717
*We are swallowed whole in one bite by the machine, now bumping against the insides of its steel armor in pitch blackness. It carries us off somewhere, each juddering step causing us bruises and jolts of pain as we are shaken about. Finally, the moving container opens, disgorging us like sacks of potatoes. We roll down a wide pipe until we finally land in a dark underground hall, barely illuminated by a single red light. We are not alone here.*

- Each Dreamer discards **1** `ether` or gains **1 Flaw**.

- Relocate the Team to the **Prison Location** on the Dreamworld Map.

# 718
*"What a curious idea – to throw one's face into the water! The Pearl Hunter did that once and has been searching for its lost visage ever since. When you lose your face, you cannot bear to live near others for long. Though maybe that's actually just a made-up excuse, so the creature can hide away in this darkness forever... All right, give me that, let's have a go!"*

*The line is cast. You don't have to wait too long, you'll be reeling something in very soon.*

- Gain **1 random card** from the Influence Market for **free**.

- Then, [resolve] -> (076)

# 720
[If you have **any Story tokens**, resolve] -> (239)

- If not – you can't do anything here.

# 722
*This place used to be beautiful. Bustling with life, people, friends, and lovers. If it was once, couldn't it be so again? Where are our friends? Have they abandoned us? Where is our home? Will thinking about the past and the future bring us solace or despair?*

- If there are **2 Webs or more** on the ***Empty Home*** tile – ***Somber thoughts drown us in their endless sea.*** – Nothing else happens, though.

- If there are **fewer than 2 Webs** on the ***Empty Home*** tile, gain **card B**.

# 723
*We arrive at the last moment, as the airship is already beginning departing procedures. We have a long journey ahead of us, but at least this way we can actually reach our destination.*

*Unfortunately they don't allow freeloaders on board, so we negotiate to work for our fare, taking orders like the rest of the crew. Labour has never been a problem for us though.*

*Maybe we can catch something valuable in the clouds?*

- Take the **top Cloud card** and place it in the Dreamscape according to the Cloud cards rules on the Dream Gate tile.

# 724
*What do we need a wheel for? Madness and fear must have taken hold in our minds.*

- **Spawn 1 Tentacle** (use Creature Shapeshifter) on this tile and roll for its Movement.

- You may add **card I** to the **Flaw deck** to **draw 4 influence cards.**

# 725
*A puny figure finally emerges from the treacle-like ooze of the swamp. It rubs its face, struggling until two clear circles finally appear in the coating of mud - eyes, probably. A third gap in the mud opens up wetly to release a short sentence: "Thanks for saving my life..."*

*So it's not a monster, after all! This is an interesting and powerful feeling – to actually save someone's life.*

Roll the **Luck die**:

- `luck-1` = Gain **all** available `gem`.

- `luck-2` = **Unseal 8 cards**.

- `luck-3` = Gain **1** `ether`.

# 726
*We try focusing all our anger to make good use of it – it makes us feel alive. But can we ever stop? Or will we lose ourselves in hatred and thrash mindlessly around forever – punishing both the world and ourselves with pain.*

- If you have the ***Calmness*** card, discard it and discard **all Web tokens** from the ***Hermitage*** and ***Life Ruins*** tiles.

- Otherwise, every Dreamer on the **Hermitage tile** suffers **1** `damage`.

# 727
*We hear a quiet prayer – someone calls to us needing our help. We close our eyes and think we understand what they want...*

*When we open our eyes again, we are somewhere else. Our clothes are now modest, we blend in well with the bleak surroundings. It's night, no sound taints the silence of this place. Patrolling drones hover silently above the ground. This district is surrounded by a high wall topped with barbed wire. The city seems rather normal – the only thing missing is freedom.*

*A young man stands next to us furtively glancing around from the shadows. We know he's a man, but he looks like a stuffed sock – just like all the residents of this place. He doesn't see us – his eyes are fixed on a balcony, imagining his lover inside the apartment, behind the drawn curtains.*

*But something else does notice us too. A beast, snarling with boundless hatred, has chosen the young man, our protege, as its prey and will seek to end his life this night. We have to help the youngster avoid the trap set by this cruel life and survive this dangerous night to meet with the one he pines for. Let's do it!*

# 728
*We accomplish the impossible! The monster falls into the swamp and sinks slowly beneath the surface. For long trepidatious moments we can't take our eyes away the spot... but there is no further movement.*

*Breathing a sigh of relief, we return to the chest and enjoy our spoils.*

- Each Dreamer gains **3** `ether`.

- Gain **2 Keys**.

- Gain **1 new random Item** from the **Item Market**.

- Then, [resolve] -> (637)

# 729
*The huge wave we're now surfing feels as tranquil as sitting in a rocking chair. We can even rest for a while without losing speed!*

- Each Dreamer on this tile may **Flip 1 Progress card** to **Unseal 5 cards**.

- Then, Relocate 1 Dreamer from this tile to any other space on the other side of the Wall of this tile.

# 730
*This moment could last forever. When we stop moving forward, something draws nearer to us... It's coming closer and closer. We do not feel fear because what approaches is familiar and dear to us.*

- Try to move, break out of this stupor – **discard 1 Turn** and [resolve] -> (044)

**OR**

- Just wait... – **discard 3 Turns** and [resolve] -> (366)

# 731
(**Note**: If you came to this script because it seemed to you that you could combine different numbers in one of the Dreams - you made a mistake otherwise continue reading.)

*Dark water crashes against the walls, droplets sharp like broken glass. The black waves resemble the outstretched wings of a huge bird flapping furiously, unsuccessfully trying to take off from the ground.*

*The waves grab and buffet us, preventing us from getting away.*

If **card C** is *not revealed* – **reveal it**. Do not discard this tile. All Dreamers on this tile may Relocate to any `start` space.

If **card C** is *already revealed* – nothing can save you, and you fail. [Resolve] -> (176)

# 732
*"It's quite tasty. You may pass."*

- Return the ***Mushroom*** card to the Secrets of this Dream.

- Each Dreamer ***Reminds*** twice.

- Move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

# 734
*Several hundred billion stars in our galaxy, several hundred billion known galaxies – are they all dead, and are we just some miraculous exception, a sad joke on a completely empty scene filled to the brim with endless nowhere?*

*For many years, the laboratory has been screening different wavelengths and intensities of cosmic noise. We came across a strange clue last year. With further research, and thanks to this device, today we received a signal... A clear signal.*

*Does this mean that we are not the only manifestation of life in this endless space? Maybe today we will prove that we are not alone.*

- Place a `block` token on this action and gain **1** `gem`.

# 735
***Ship's log 12***. 

*I set the course again. I will use the rest of the fuel for the last turning manoeuvre. The
engines, left unpowered for years, come alive again to correct this steady course toward nothingness. Finally, a sound reaches my ears, and I see the light that I had long forgotten.*

*The engines splutter to life. The unchanging palette of inaccessible stars finally shifts, the ship turns back. The remaining fuel gives one last boost. I don't know if I'll ever get home, but it's better to die on a road that has a purpose at last. That gives me hope. Home has become my religion, which gives me strength. I move towards it...*

*The return is an immeasurably long period of lost consciousness, hallucinations, strange dreams, physical pain, and madness. I can dream of whole worlds, but they are different from the ones I remember. A human can't be alone for so long away from their home. The days stretch into months and months into aeons. How can a person survive for aeons? The mind and body have their limits. But what awaits at the end is the faint light of hope in the tunnel of deadly darkness.*

*What awaits, in any form, is home. Even if empty and extinct, it is still a better grave than the godless emptiness of space.*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.

- Cross out the number on the **"Reading the Ship's log"** and write a new one: **"712"**.

# 736
*We see the Mill tower in front of us, very close. Unfortunately, brambly thickets block the road. We have to find a way around or break through them somehow.*

- Reveal **tile Y**.

*One of the workers passes nearby, hunched and barely shuffling. When it crosses a small bridge, slime-covered musicians emerge from the swamp and play a slow march to the rhythm of its steps. This is a rather bleak show. As the music slowly accelerates, the worker adjusts his gait to keep in time. Did it work then?*

# 737
*A second great ocean, calm and quiet, without any visible storms or waves, stretches into infinity in all directions – a boundless outer space, full of unreachable stars. It is difficult to say how long we have been drifting because nothing here counts down days and nights.*

*We are in a strange flying saucer. How did this happen? We bought it at the market, we wanted to see how high it could lift us – and, at some point, we slipped away from the gravitational pull of the planet – just bad luck.*

*We pass a lazy comet – the first object in a very long time – then for a long time, nothing. And finally, after countless days, something (or someone?) approaches us, drifting in space like we do. It's something we can push away from and finally turn back...*

- Do your best – it may be your last chance to battle for your life. You only have **1 Turn**...

Note: What are the Bowl and Checkpoints described in the Special Rules on the Dream Gate tile? Forget about them for now.

# 738
*Now, as the wind presses mast against forestay, you can calmly repair the backstay.*

- Discard the **current Turn card**.

# 739
*Souvenirs, mementos, countless trinkets. Pleasant and unpleasant, as if it was a duty to hold onto both. Why do people keep such sad things at all? Do they like suffering? I must admit that sadness is sometimes tasty.*

*Then, something begins to crawl out of a nearby mirror. It has not taken form yet, but we already see hands reaching for our neck. We have to break the glass before the monster gets out!*

- If this is a `light` space – **add 1 Morphing**.

- If this is a `night` space – **add 3 Morphings**.

- Finally, you may Move the **Locker 2 spaces** or **Relocate the Lamp to any tile**.

# 740
*As the last of the ghosts dissipates, we can finally take a deep breath. They will be at peace for a while – this fight must have cost them a lot.*

This Slumber ends.

- Return this Slumber tile to the Secrets.

- Add **tile II-38 A (Fearspecters)** to the Slumber deck.

# 741
*How many floors do you think the tallest building of the dream world has? This one here has at least a thousand – it's one of the highest. We think the view from the roof of this skyscraper would be amazing – but the problem is that the lifts are not working today.*

*The door of one of the postboxes is open, and inside we see a golden envelope labeled: "Money Back."*

**Choose 1:**

- We could inform the recipient. Let's check... Oh, three hundred and third floor, it would be a LONG climb – you may **Seal 3 cards** or suffer **1** `damage` to [resolve] -> (303)

- It's not our problem if someone has been careless. Should we take it? – gain **4** `gem`.

- It's none of our business – let's just get out of here.

# 742
*"The mysterious island lies just next to dry land. But it's still hard to get there. This knowledge makes many adventurers' heads spin – an unknown land hidden under their noses."*

- Gain **1** `gem`.

# 743
*This thing is right next to us, just a little longer and... As if hypnotized, we are still waiting, and time seems to freeze.*

**Choose 1:**

- Stand up and move on – **discard 1 Turn** and [resolve] -> (044)

- Just wait – **discard 3 Turns** and [resolve] -> (366)

# 744
*Ok, let's pretend nothing happened.*

- Discard the **current Turn card**.

# 745
*It's difficult to focus on anything here because on top of a movie is playing in the background (nothing new, just some old rerun), there is also a theatrical performance on the stage in front of it. At the same time, loud music flows out of speakers drowning out the all the actors' voices. Each patron sits at a table and bleak, cheerless waiters set dishes and cutlery endlessly – even without the music, the clang of cutlery would drown out the movie.*

*If that wasn't enough to distract you, a games console is mounted at each table. It's just a little hard to focus on anything.*

- You may discard **1 Turn** to cure **3** `damage`.

# 746
*We see a group of strange silhouettes when we leave the port. They are almost as strange as we are – a large man with a mechanical arm, a short woman hovering over the ground, and something with a hat on their head, crawling on all fours. They look around cautiously, a perfect echo of our behavior. Maybe we will meet them again?*

*<u>Victory.</u>* Each Dreamer cures **1** `damage` or **Unseals 1 card**.

- Gain **card II-34 W (Real Treasure Note card)**

- Restore 3 Shopping cards (II-41 C).

- Discard **all story tokens** gained in this Dream.

- Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets.

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream – you can still come back here to try again.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 747
*Knowledge of the battlefield is now the most important thing. The dust conceals a maze of streets and ruined buildings. Sometimes, when we really
strain our eyes, we can even see small, green manifestations of life - other than the ubiquitous pale birds, eating leftovers hidden among the dust.*

- Reveal **tile V (Scavenger)** unless it's already revealed.

- **Add 1 Turn.**


# 748
*Is it not over yet? We are barely able to stay on our feet, but the others we face have also gone through many hardships this night. What's next? Some ghost? Maybe a robot? Bring it on!*

- Each Dreamer cures **1** `damage` or **Unseals 2 cards**.

- Resolve the top card from the **Arena Fate deck** (remember to add 1 Dreamscape Slumber Map tile!).

- Resolve the top Slumber tile from the **Arena Slumber deck**, but add **5 Morphings** during its setup.

- If you don't achieve Victory in that Slumber, end your Arena cycle and resolve **Awakening**.

If you end this Slumber with a Victory, place **1** more `ether` on the Dream Gate tile. Then, choose one:

- [End your Arena cycle and **claim your reward**] -> (287)

- Move the `marker` on the Dream Gate tile to the next slot, following the arrows, and resolve the script displayed in the slot you just reached.

# 749
*At night, faceless shadows are drawn here from various parts of the city. Whispers intermingle, exchanging knowledge about the daily events occurring throughout the city. Under cover of darkness, detectives appear here to find answers to their pressing questions. Information is cheap, but nobody expects too much from life here.*

- Settle all Businesses from any 1 chosen tile. Then, if there are no Dreamers or Denizens on that tile, you may replace it with the other corresponding tile that was not drawn during the Dream Setup.

# 750
*Time is malicious by nature. When we hurry, it runs faster; when we wait, it slows down. When we feel pain, it turns into eternity; when we are happy it tries to get through days and years at an express pace. The clock and calendar are its obedient soldiers, ready to take the last scintilla of joy from us.*

*A large clock hangs on the wall of the station. Half the people here are rushing with suitcases to catch their train, and the other half are waiting forever until their train arrives. Very few smiles, lots of irritation and pent-up anger. What are we doing here? We are rushing and, at the same time, waiting for a train. Heavy baggage hinders our movements. Wait, what time is it? Surely, it's time to wake up, but we still can't. We must get on any train and go somewhere.*

*It reminds us of the time when our world was ending, Wait, what's this thought? When our world was ending?... What a crazy thought! The chaos of the station has crept into our heads. It's hard to be yourself here.*

- Each Dreamer must **Seal 3 cards** or **discard their Mask**.

# 751
*One risky step too many...*

*The building was swaying disturbingly from the very moment we set foot in it and for a while we almost stopped paying attention to it. Yet this time it tilted more and... slowly at first, then faster and faster! We begin to slide across the rotten floor narrowing avoiding old furniture gliding towards us. The city horizon lurches at an unnatural angle outside the window. And then, it's all over. The walls crack violently then
there is only chaos, darkness and nothing more...*

*<u>Failure.</u>* Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets.

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream – you can still come back here to try again.

- Add **card C (Rats)** to the **Fate deck** unless it's already there.

- Change the Season to **Season of Watchers**.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.

# 752
*The crate is very unstable – we almost fall into the water before jumping.*

How much `yellow` did you spend?

- **1-4** – Resolve ***Cold Bath***.

- **5 or more** – [Resolve] -> (941)

*We ponder whether it's always the best plan to jump as far as possible. After all, we could miss something valuable that had been closer to us.*

# 753
*Well, what else could we buy here? We browse the colourful promises full of power. The masked man pressures us and ridicules us, trying to stop us from backing out of the deal.*

*"Are you scared? I think you're a wimp. This isn't for you. You'd better retreat to your hole in the ground."*

*It's a peculiar type of hard sell – we feel we should buy something to prove something to the seller. Though we could also back off, right?*

- Gain **2 Flaws** and `block` this Map Action. Then, you may suffer **1** `damage` to gain **1 Story token**.

**OR**

- Return **card G (Chemicals)** to the Secrets of this Dream.

# 754
*In this huge, underground maze, we don't meet any people, only strange, often grotesque creatures, filthy, frustrated, boiling with anger. It's curious that in our world, we treated such creatures with contempt. Here, it's the other way around – we are the outcasts, we stick out, not fitting in this place. Things that are normal to us are strange and unnatural here.*

*We proceed with caution, unsuccessfully trying to blend into these odd surroundings.*

# 755
*The laboratory is destroyed. All unnatural movement stops. The terrible substitute for life which had reanimated them leaves the bodies of these unfortunate people. We sit among the ruins. Few pieces of equipment still work, smoke rises up to the ceiling. Everything is spotted with water. Printouts of projects and complicated analyses lie on the floor. "Whole planet is dead on the other side," "Virus is spreading," "Shared reality cannot exist," and more hopeless headlines.*

*All leads and maps guided us here, to this laboratory. For what purpose? There is a silver device on the floor, now detached from one of the machines. We pick it up.*

- Gain **card K (The 2nd Silver Key).**

*<u>Victory.</u>* Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`. Each Dreamer cures **3** `damage` and **Unseals 3 cards**.

- Add **tile II-36 F** to the Slumber Map deck.

- Add 6 **cards II-41 P** to the Influence Market.

- Restore 3 Shopping cards (II-41 C).

- Change the Season to **Season of Regeneration**.

- Discard the current Dreamscape.

- Add all Influence cards of this Dream that you did not gain to the Influence Market.

- Remove from the game all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks), as well as the Dream Gate tile of this Dream.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.

# 756
- If the card **"Let's sail!"** is not revealed, or if the current Turn Suit is not `clubs`, you row as hard as you can, but you don't seem to make any headway at all.

- If the card **"Let's sail!"** is revealed and the current Turn Suit is `clubs`, resolve the following:

*I drop one of the oars... What now?*

- [Row harder with only one oar] -> (553)

- [Start the engine] -> (887)

- [Look for the lost oar] -> (102)

# 757
*The Moon is barely visible through thick layers of clouds. The rain beats down on the cobblestones in anger and streams of mud flow through the narrow streets. There is no one outside except us - everyone else is safely inside. The patches of warm light radiating from their windows further emphasise the cold and darkness around us. 

*There are so many lanterns and lights from these houses – how will we find our silver lamp here? One of the doors catches our attention – on it is a plate carved with the name "Shelley." Maybe we should start there?*

*An antique car rolls down the street – our imagination conjures up images of gangsters with tommy guns leaping from their vehicles and gunning us down but nothing like that happens of course. Everything here looks like a crime movie from the forties though.*

*We feel eerie, sinister darkness just behind us. This ghoulish thing wants to destroy or enslave us. It lurks in the corners of our vision, and is probably getting ready to attack.*

- Remember that in this Dream, in contrast to the rulebook, `night` in the form of Darkness Tentacles **nullifies** the `light` on their spaces (and any space in range 1).

# 758
*The sad worker mutters to himself:*

*"I've always made mud with pride. But lately, I have my doubts. It's probably just fatigue and my health problems. You know, it's hard to bear this pace until the very end. But I can do it. I'm going back to work... The mud won't make itself!*

*"Oh, hi! Can I help you with something?"*

- You may discard **1** `gem` to **Restore 1 Item**.

# 759
*Nothing drives progress like conflicts and clashes. At least the Endless City authorities believe that. Therefore, from time to time, bloody competitions are organized in special arenas. Everything is broadcast live throughout the city - the most expensive ads are featured. Everyone can take part in the struggle to prove their true worth, both to themselves and to others. Oh, there is also an address where you can sign up. Well...*

- Gain **tile II-40 O ("Welcome to the Arena" special Dream gate tile)**.

# 760
*We wind up the old deformed clock, trying to coax some additional minutes or maybe hours out of its aged springs and cogs.*

**Choose one:**

- Add **1 Turn** and place *all* Dreamers in `start` spaces.

- Add **1 Turn** and each Dreamer suffers **1** `damage`.

- Each Dreamer spends **1** `ether`. Then **add 2 Turns**.

# 761
*This ancient machine seems functional – but how do we turn on this gigantic contraption? And what does it do?*

*Slender, emaciated figures move around, slow and absent, like zombies. They approach the glass, embrace it, trying to lick up remnants of the colourful substances.*

- Reveal **card B**.

# 762
*"It used to be better. In the old days, I used to cast a line and immediately pull out whatever I could dream of. Everything was so big and so easy, I could catch literally anything. Today, I wait for countless hours, and nothing bites. Sometimes I hook something, but usually it's just worthless rubbish. I don't know if the world has become too miserable or whether I am too old. Or maybe I just don't have the right lure? Maybe you have something more suitable? Give me that, and we'll try to catch something for you!"*

**You may choose one:**

- Discard **1** `ether` - [resolve] -> (617)
- Discard **1** `gem` - [resolve] -> (105)
- Discard your **Mask** - [resolve] -> (718)

# 763
*We found the passage! The gate to the magnificent city is open again. As we pass the golden towers and alabaster walls, the fairy-tale inhabitants look at us curiously, as if they haven't seen any newcomers for centuries.*

*Our great deeds are appreciated and soon we are met by the royal guard who leads us before the king of this boundless but non-existent land. Our actions are very important for all these non-existent people (and not only people). Those who don't exist will never forget us. It is a pity that all this simply does not exist. It's beautiful here nonetheless.*

- Any Dreamer may discard **1** of their Masks to gain **1** new Mask. Dreamers may also swap their Masks with each other. Now, you may look at the Mask rules (on their backs) before deciding which one to choose.

- Each Dreamer draws **2 random cards** from the Influence Market and may gain **1** of these cards (without paying any cost). If they don't want either, they gain **2** `ether` instead.

*<u>Victory.</u>* Each Dreamer cures **1** `damage` or **Unseals 1 card**.

- Restore 3 Shopping cards (II-41 C).

- Change the Season to **Season of Secret Paths**.

- Discard the current Dreamscape.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.

# 764
If your text or in your drawing is a light or something referring to it (like sun, flashlight, candle, etc.), gain **1** `gem` and cure **1** `damage`.

If your text or in your drawing is a darkness or something referring to it (like a shadow, night, etc.), **Seal 2 cards** and **add 1 Morphing**.

- Then, put a `block` token on this action.

# 765
*In this part of the city, cobwebs are even more numerous. They resemble tussled hair, bejewelled with many raindrops. We accidentally touch one of them and discover that the water is salty and leaves trails which almost burn our skin! We are nervous but the atmosphere of this place could kill any butterfly that would like to inhabit our stomachs – not to mention that they would probably be eaten by spiders first! Thinking about it makes our eyes water.*

# 766
*Dripping rain, the sounds and lights of the distant Endless City. The cobblestones are slick with rainwater, brick buildings look dilapidated and abandoned... The drizzle thins out the surrounding mist. We are in the Foggy Docks, with its many warehouses, ships, and narrow alleys. On a rainy night, a single lantern lights up the gloom, calling us...*

*We have magnifying glasses in hand, and capes to protect us from the rain. We're looking around. Every detail seems to be significant and tells a story. The investigation is ongoing. Part of it is about the case of... Well, it's just about the case.*

*In addition to that investigation, we also have our own business to attend to here. Before we arrived in this world, we had previously sent a parcel, addressed to ourselves. It must have passed right here through the port. If everything went according to plan, the parcel should still be waiting for us. Probably in the warehouse.*

- If you're reading this, you have probably placed **cards A and B**. And you probably don't understand what all this is about. You can only look at the backs of these cards. **You cannot look at their fronts yet**. Before you can flip these cards and resolve their fronts, you *must first complete the tasks on their backs*.

# 767
*Did I mention that I don't like looking in mirrors? You never know if you will see something terrifying. Well...*

*Damn. That's what I'm talking about. The reflection in the mirror is not me, I hope – I'm not a cockroach after all!*

- Reveal **card F**.

# 768
*...except for one small spark.*

*This single spark of light is enough to give us the momentum to try again. We crawl through the void, then endlessly through the dense darkness, until we finally see the world again – immersed in deep shadows, yes, but real nonetheless. We are back.*

- Reshuffle the **12 Turn cards** and make a **new Turn deck**.

# 769
*Our chain fits the ancient ones almost perfectly – we just need a little more time to connect them all!*

Depending on which tile you placed the Influence card with the Chain on, resolve accordingly:

- **A2 tile** – **Distribute `player` `damage` between Dreamers** or the Chain breaks (if it breaks, return that Influence card to the Influence Market).

- **A3 tile** – Dreamers **discard a total of `player` cards from hands** or the Chain breaks (if it breaks, return that Influence card to the Influence Market).

**B2 tile** – Each Dreamer **discards their Mask** (unless a Dreamer does not have an active Mask) or the Chain breaks (if it breaks, return that Influence card to the Influence Market).

**B3 tile** – Each Dreamer **Flips 1 Progress card** or the Chain breaks (if it breaks, return that Influence card to the Influence Market).

# 770
*"No! Let us go, I don't want to see this. Your despair, pain, and sadness – it's all yours, not ours, I don't want it from you! Let us out! Help!"*

- Each Dreamer gains **2 Flaws.**

# 771
Which **Deliverance Card** did you use?

[Rage] -> (1057)

[Intimidation] -> (1195)

[Deception] -> (1077)

[Understand] -> (1218)

[Open yourself] -> (1130)


# 772
*The room ends here. A torso emerges from the darkness, reaching out for us with its gnarled arms.* - If this is a `night` space, place 1 `threat` in this space (max. 1 `threat` per space).

*There is a door here!*

- Reveal **card D** and **tile Y**.

Note that **tile Y** is placed on the Dreamscape board in an unusual way. *Look carefully at the grid.*


# 773
***BANG!***

*A shot rings out...*

Roll the **Luck die**:

- `luck-x` - *Ouch!* Your Dreamer is dead. *Resolve Death of a Dreamer.*

- `luck-blank` - Suffer 3 `damage`.

- `luck-1` - Suffer 2 `damage`.

- `luck-2` - Suffer 1 `damage`.

- `luck-3` - *Yikes, the bad man didn't get me this time...* Nothing happens.

# 774
*Scaffolding extends dozens of yards high. When we look at the sky, we suddenly notice that several stars are moving and appear to be expanding. People around us also stare at the sky – something is happening. The show in the firmament becomes more spectacular and disturbing. When we realize that this is not an illusion, we are paralyzed by a sudden wave of disbelief and deep sadness. So, is this the end of the world? Is this Judgment Day, and will there be no tomorrow? Silver craft land one after another in the city, and probably in all cities around the world. Does the world we know end now?*

*When the first craft touches down, we see creatures crawl out of it – they resemble ants from this distance. When we see the rays shaking skyscrapers and people searching hopelessly for shelter, we know we are witnessing the beginning of the end.*

**Choose one:**

- [Stay right here and wait for the end] -> (836)

- [Hide in the renovated building] -> (096)

- [Run to the outskirts of the city and the allotments] -> (502)

# 775
*Not so long ago, life used to flourish here – under the dust which blankets everything, we can see outlines of streets, once-prosperous shops, and residential houses interspersed with tree stumps and dead tufts of grass. The coloured signs are broken and covered with a gray layer. Everything was buried through the passage of time.*

*We notice traces of giant teeth on the buildings – something sinister has devoured this world. Abandoned shopping trolleys form a massive pile – there are thousands of them, useless because nothing else can be bought anymore. There's nothing left to devour here.*

*While wandering among the ruins, we see a great sleeping beast in the distance – it looks like a beautiful woman for a moment, but the illusion fades away, revealing a monstrous, eternally hungry creature. Ghostly shadows move slowly around her, shackled to the dead shopping trolleys.*

- Note: If any Dreamer dies in this Dream, return ***all Influence cards placed on the Dreamscape to the Influence Market***. Wait – what? Cards placed on the Dreamscape? You'll learn about it later, but for now, just remember this information.

# 776
*The heavy door of the Warehouse is open. Infinite shelves, each endlessly high and wide, contain all sorts of crates, chests, packages, barrels, sacks, and other containers in a variety of shapes and sizes. You can only see a small fraction of it all – the rest is hidden in the darkness.*

Check your Dream Gate Tile to see whether you entered the Gateway to the **New Dream** or the **Old Dream**.

[If you're playing a **New Dream**] -> (618)

[If you're playing an **Old Dream**] -> (746)

# 777
***Ship's log 15***. 

*The sun sets slowly, a light, cool wind rises. Clouds rush through the sky, small raindrops spatter the path. The grass waves, the shadows begin to dance across the fields, trees rustle, the birds' singing slowly stops.*

*It's time to go home... I need to sweep away the dust, air the place to get rid of the smell of long absence, and brew tea in my forlorn mug. I'm going to sleep in my long-forgotten bed. I want to snuggle myself into a blanket full of warmth and good memories.*

*It's good to be home again...*

- Each Dreamer gains **2** `ether`.

This is the **last** entry in the ship's log. Remove the **"Reading the Ship's log"** from the game.

# 778
*A hidden room! It is pleasantly bright, and warm, quiet music flows from within. We immediately start to feel safer than in the cold and dark halls of the library.*

- You may add **card D** to your **Discard pile** if it's still available, to **add 3 Turns** and gain **4** `gem`.

# 780
*There are so many roads to enlightenment... Good movies, wise books, conversations, contemplation... Maybe glowing fungi are another of them? What could possibly go wrong? Anyway, they don't taste so bad...*

- Gain **1 Flaw card**.

- **Unseal 10 cards**.

# 781
*We remember all those people who helped us in the past, passers-by who were nice or simply smiled at us. Visions of their kind faces should rouse a wave of calmness to ease our hearts.*

- If there are **more than 2 Webs** on the ***Hermitage*** tile - *Just thinking about anyone makes us angry.* - Choose 2 `red` intent cards in your Discard pile and add them to your hand.

- If there are **fewer than 3 Webs** on the ***Hermitage*** tile, gain **card F**.

# 782
*We grab the board leaning against the wall but a stabbing pain makes us withdraw our hands. We notice a small splinter embedded in our finger. It immediately grows larger, causing our finger to bleed profusely. What the hell is this?*

- You suffer **1** `damage`.

You may cure it now if you **Seal 6 cards**.

# 783
*"You promised me so much, and now you're gone..."*

*Enough!*

*Finally... The closet is empty. A dirty smudge reaches a dark corner, where everything is piled up. Something still twitches under the pile of clothes. But, eventually, it stops moving.*

- Add **card I (Come Here)** to the Fate deck (if it's still in the Secrets of this Dream).

- Place a `block` token on the **'Check the wardrobe' action on B2**.

- Place **a Wound token** (from the `damage` pool) in your space.

- Spawn **1 Cockroach** on each `spawn` space.

# 785
*"I don't like it. Take it back!"*

Nothing happens – take back this element.

# 786
*So that's what all this is about. It's a revolver! When the protege hid it here, he had a look of determination and madness on his face. We have to stop him!*

- You may discard this card – then Relocate all Dreamers/Protege to `start` spaces.

# 787
*The Mill stands at the crossroads. At a crossroads, you always have to make a choice to move on, it's unavoidable. What choice awaits us here? Time is running out, and our legs are slowly getting muddier and muddier. We hear grotesque music floating across the water that suits the ubiquitous swamp very well.*

*A leaflet printed on a large leaf floats on the surface of a stinking swamp. It's the only colourful thing in sight.*

*"This is the place where the potential for career and personal development awaits all ambitious people in a nice, swampy atmosphere. It's the Swamp Mill! This is where soil is mixed with water, creating all the mud in the world. It's tough, responsible work. The grinding of the
big wheel, the lapping of water, the swampy vapours – maybe it's your new home! The only obstacle to your success is you. Don't be afraid of your dreams! Turn them into action!"*



# 788
*Domain: Medicine. Project objective: To use compressed imagination and deleted memories to heal human husks. Problems: zombie syndrome, and void sprouting in the heart. Research was conducted on twelve volunteers and one convict. The results...*

- Add **card I (Clinic)** to the **Fate deck**.


# 789
*As the dust from the crumbling buildings irritates our eyes, we realize that this world is damaged beyond repair. We can't do anything to fix it, and we can't run away from our negative thoughts. But nothing prevents us from building something new. Can we do it? Can we expect this new world to be a good thing? Do we have enough faith, enough positivity to bring it to life?*


# 790
*"Normally I do not eat such things, you'd be barking up the wrong tree. But... Today I have a desire for something completely new – so give it to me!"*

- Remove this envelope from the game. Now you have to work out a new way of storing its contents. ***Remind*** twice and move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.


# 791
*"Ahbwalala! And what do you think?"

- Reveal **card B**.

# 792
*We watch two oceans collide. The one beneath is magical, impenetrable, turbulent, and full of life – it flagellates itself with raging waves, splashing around green tears and whipped foam. The one above is calm – adorned with stars, flawless, and boundless. Their battle happens on the horizon – the only neutral ground – trying to push it upwards or downwards as they seek to expand their territory.*

*We stand at the shore – the last bastion of the third power in this conflict, but it seems too weak in comparison to compete with the oceans. Both water and sky call to us like two great mysteries waiting for someone to explore them. We go back to the tavern to warm ourselves with a hot drink and find shelter from the cold, salty rain. We will set off soon, we wait only for a storm to strike. On the calm sea we would never find the secret path we're looking for. May the stars that lead us not disappoint.*

# 793
*Something lies on the tall pile of old furniture. What's that?*

- If the **Locker** is in this space, you may add **3 Morphings** and **Spawn 1 Puppet** to add **card I (What's that?)** to the **Fate deck**.

- Finally, you may **Move the Locker 2 spaces** or **Relocate the Lamp to any tile**.

# 794
*It works, but the end of the line whips me in the face.*

- Suffer 1 `damage`.

- Discard the **current Turn card**.

# 795
*We wipe the slime off the big red button. We push on it with all our might, and finally, it gives up. Somewhere, far away in the dark, we can hear the bubbling of water and the crunching of a mechanism. Something emerges – among the faint reflections on the black surface, we can see several dark shapes.*

- Reveal **card A** and **card B**.

# 797
*Here you can understand what this whole city is about. You don't have to win here, nothing will happen if you lose – it's about life, doing business, making profits, getting what you want. You know what I mean?*

*And if you want something more – look to the city limits, where the vibrant bustle dies away, and where concrete gives way to wild greenery. Perhaps this is the gateway we are seeking?*

- You may spend **1** `gem` to Settle any 1 Business from any space.

- You may place 2 Businesses in any spaces with any Turn Suit symbol (max. 1 Business per space) to gain **card G (I breathe the city)**.

# 798
*The guard holds us by the collar like rude students, our feet barely touching the ground as we follow them into the unknown. With every step, we become smaller, and our captor grows stronger...*

*"Well, you got what you deserved." The stem voice does not leave us much hope.*

**This Slumber ends.**

- Each Dreamer discards all their `red-progress` cards OR each Dreamer suffers 1 `damage`. Relocate the Team to the **Prison Location** on the Dreamworld Map.

- Return this Slumber tile to the Secrets.

- Add **tile II-38 S** (Furious Warden) to the Slumber deck.

# 799
*We are tired... Forcing ourselves to do ANYTHING feels impossible. We've been like this for too long, and we grow weary of it. We have to rest, but we can't – when we close our eyes, we can only think of our failures, and that we could have done things better in the past. The future isn't welcoming either – we have so many things to do tomorrow.*

# 801
*The feeling of danger intensifies so much that we instinctively look for something that could serve as a weapon. And then we remember the oldest ancestor of all weapons - a crude rock. We quickly dig out a loose piece of cobblestone.*

*We feel as if this stone was waiting just for us. Armed with this improvised projectile, we begin to consider our options. After all, nothing happens here by accident.*

**Choose one:**

- [Throw the stone at the creeping darkness] -> (464)

- [Throw the stone at the window above the closed door] -> (053)

# 802
*We try to get through the thorny wall of plant life as it looks like there's something behind it. And to our horror, we discover that a creature has made its lair here...*

- Reveal **card G** and **Spawn 1 Grunting Creature** in this space (use Creature Shapeshifter).

# 803
*"I am not here but somewhere else entirely. You have simply stumbled upon my shadow, which cries because it wandered off and got lost after becoming separated from me. It's scared and tries to hide from what lurks in the dark. Can you hear the other shadows too? The unbearable dark choir of the lost, wailing in fear and screaming for help. The noise can become deafening if you focus on it too much.*

*"I hope I haven't gone on too long... But thank you."*

*The shadow begins to dissolve into the air, although now we realise that we can actually hear distant screams and crying. There are too many of them to make out what any are saying, and we try to ignore them as best we can. Eventually, the shadow disappears – taking another small part of this world with it.*

**Choose 1:**

- Remove **1 chosen Morphing** *from the game*.

- Remove **1 chosen Slumber tile** *from the game*.

Then, *remove this Fate card from the game*.

# 804
*It's a bad time, I shouldn't be here.*

Suffer **1** `damage` and **Seal 1 card**.

# 806
*"So little energy for something that was once a living creature. Such a pity."*

- Return the ***Meat*** card to the Item Market.

- Each Dreamer ***Reminds*** twice.

Move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

# 807
*We fall onto a crate floating on the surface as we splash, kick and paddle ungainly, trying to stay afloat. After a while, we manage to find our balance.*

- Reveal **card C**, if it is not revealed yet.

- Relocate to **any crate** on **C4**.

# 808
*An old woman picks up porcelain figurines from the furniture, cleaning them brusquely and placing them back methodically. She stops to look at photographs from time to time, lost in memories.*

*"Since I'm alone, I will dust all our souvenirs till they're spick and span so that when they come back, we can admire them together..."*

- You may **Seal 1 card** to **Restore 1 Item**.

# 809
*No... Not the shattered glass again!* - If this is a `night` space, spend **2** `red` or suffer **1** `damage`.

*A huge closet slumbers in a pile of rubbish. We hear a gentle rhythmic hiss coming from its drawers. Well, we probably shouldn't open it... Or maybe there's something useful inside?*

- [If you decide to open it] -> (276)

# 811
*The evening reading turns out to be extremely interesting and a real page-turner. One might even say addictive. As we devour the story, the world it portrays seems more and more real, and the room we are in less and less so, until we can smell and hear the locations it describes. Finally the room and the book vanish altogether, letters and words disappearing, and... we find ourselves standing in a dark hall.*

*It's a labyrinth of huge rooms, a jumble of floors interconnected with stairs and instead of walls – endless shelves filled with books. This truly is a great library. These forgotten books hold the all the stories of the lives of people, both those long gone and those still living. Some of their
sparks were extinguished long ago without leaving any trace in the world – but they still made their mark here.*

*By reading these books, you could live a million lives. Lives unlike anything we've ever known or experienced. There is also your book somewhere, though that one is still being written.*

*Is there anyone guarding this place? We'd better tread carefully.*

# 812
*It's hard to tell how much time has passed since we started looking for the exit, but finally, we emerge from this bloody subterranean nightmare.*

- If there's `threat` in *range 1*, suffer **1** `damage`.

- Relocate to any `start` space. You may reveal any 1 unrevealed Map tile in the same row or column and place your Dreamer in the `start` space of that tile.

# 814
*Someone has carved a plan of the entire building on the brick wall. "You are here" is marked with an X. Ah, now we understand! It's hard to figure out how all these passages and corridors connect without a map.*

- If all Dreamers are on **C3**, you may discard any Floors (back to the Floors deck).

- Discard *all* **Rats** from each discarded Floor card.

- If there is a **Fearspecter** on a discarded Floor card, Relocate it to any `spawn` space.

# 816
*One more button? We hit it with all our might – and the old mechanism grinds to life immediately. The whole island shakes and a stone bridge emerges from the water.*

- Reveal **card F**.

# 817
*We pass by a family that is already heading towards the exit. The man looks at us. It's a proud look that mockingly says, "I've seen everything first before you even got here." He says to his wife in passing, or maybe a little to us, "I liked the car in the underground garage the best. Gorgeous! First class..."*

# 818
*The people seem afraid.*

*"Please don't ughruu tnod kcatta xolp! Setam kaeps, I swear!"*

*If we press them a little more, we will definitely get what we are looking for - some hint about how to get to the Mill.*

- You may spend an additional **1** `red` or suffer **1** `damage` to reveal **card B**.

# 819
*A thin, tired woman holds a broken radio, trying to open it with a screwdriver.*

*"For some reason it stopped working recently... I'll try to fix it to pass the time until evening comes..."*

**Choose 1:**

- You may **Unflip 1 card**.

**OR**

- You may **seal 2 cards** to **Unseal 1 chosen card**.

# 820
*The fisherman examines every fish he caught, before letting them go, one by one.*

*"This one is innocent... This one has never done me any harm..."*

*From time to time, he hesitates and tosses a creature into the second basket – filled with pearls, salt-covered figurines, sponges, or underwater flowers. And he murmurs: "This one is nasty. Bit my toe, cast some vicious curses... It deserves a miserable fate." Then, he glances over at us and we are drawn into conversation.*

*He notices our shoes and tells us that we can use them to surf on waves. "But be wary, children, you may regret not taking the boat with you – the storm is relentless." He pats the side of his vessel. "But I'm staying here and you're not worthy to borrow this gem. The storm is approaching, it'll be here soon. If I were you, I would visit the observatory first – many an adventurer have found their stars there. I could lend you the map of this region, but you must pawn something precious."*

- You may choose **1 Item** (active or from the Storage) and place it under the Dream Gate tile to reveal **card I (Ocean map)**. But beware, if you fail this Dream, you will lose this Item.

# 822
*The heavy oak door is sealed. It mocks the rain and our efforts. After a moment of struggle, we see that it's useless. The door won't even budge.*

*But something glints out from a knothole high on the door. Let's try and stretch...*

- Gain **1** `gem`.

# 823
Check how many `marker` tokens are on the Dream Gate tile.

- ***If you don't have 3 markers*** - the door won't budge. Hurry! Try performing other actions from the **A2 tile**, there must be a way to open this door. **Stop reading now** and go back.

- If there are **3** `marker`, discard them and reveal **tile Z** - remember that when there are references to tiles within a Dream this is shorthand to take the specific tile *of that dream* - in this case retrieve **Tile I-01 Z**. When you reveal this card, you can see that this tile has **A3** in the top left corner so you can line it up with the board space (also marked **A3**) and place it down - it should go directly to the right of the starting **Dreamscape map tile**.

Then [resolve] -> (173).

# 824
***Ship's log 14***. 

*I reminisce about my departure a long time ago. I try to convince myself that the rocket blew up into a billion pieces just after lift-off instead of the Earth, that all that has happened in the intervening countless years in the cosmic void were only the dreams of a stray soul.*

*However when I look at my radar - it only detects small debris scattered everywhere at the coordinates. I can see the familiar arrangement of stars and the Sun there but nothing more - no planet. Only emptiness.*

- Each Dreamer suffers **1** `damage` or gains **1 Flaw**.

- Cross out the number on the **"Reading the Ship's log"** and write a new one: **"777."**

# 825
*Is it a train or the digestive system of a large worm crawling through an eroded underground tunnel? We feel burning pain every time we touch a wall or a seat. This thing should not exist at all but it seems to be able to carry people. Will we survive to the end of this journey?*

*At last, the train emerges from the endless tunnel* – if you survived, resolve the **Get on a Train script** from the Dream Gate tile.

# 827
*Interesting that we even have spaceports... I probably missed something. The tourists look very strange, and I could swear that not everyone comes
from Earth. I see cyborgs, weird people dressed in shimmering suits, completely different guards to those in the city, mighty robots, and unusual, leashed animals. Every minute a shiny line arcs across the sky – another departure or landing.*

*We can also buy unique vehicles here.*

- Settle any **1 Business** from any spaces.

- You may spend **1** `gem` to gain **card B (Wing Glider)**.

# 829

- If you have the ***Little Things*** card, each Dreamer may **Unflip 1 card**.

Otherwise, nothing happens.

# 830
*We find a place hidden within the Great Sea, where peace and tranquility await us. The clouds part and the celestial vault unravels before us – it looks like a canvas prepared with an azure dye, ready for a new session of artistic creation. We wait patiently for the artist – the night – to appear. As Nyx paints her deepening shades across the sky, newly-created stars start to dance in the firmament.*

- Gain **card G (Orion's Belt)**.

# 831
If the card **"Let's sail!"** is *not revealed*, or if the current Turn Suit is **not** `diamonds`, *we climb the mast skillfully. But why do we do this?*

If the card **"Let's sail!"** *is revealed* and the current Turn Suit is `diamonds`, resolve the following:

*A wild squall blows. What do we do?*

[Trim the sail] -> (205)

[Ease the sail] -> (794)

[Ease the sail slightly] -> (949)

# 832
*"I knew it! I felt it. Every night a filthy rat tries to sneak into the warehouse! This is going to be fun, at last something's happening to break up the monotony of the night watch. A rough brawl is a good brawl. Boys, the entertainment is here!"*

*A lengthy whistle rings out, and bulky men run out of shady alleys.*

- Each Dreamer in *range 1* suffers **1** `damage` and is Relocated to the `start` space.

# 833
Is the Room space `light`?

- [**Yes**] -> (689)

- **No** – *When we look about us at the room we are in, safe and protected, hope creeps back to us. But what's next?*

Remember that you can always come back to this script when the Room space is `light`.

# 834
*It is not the end. This is not the Heart of the Underground yet. The underground stretches on.* 

- [You may leave this room and move on] -> (131)

*Or stay here for a while.*

# 835
*With the help of the Locker, we climb even higher. What is that? There are photos of this scarecrow thing, the toy that was lost long ago by the residents.*

- If the Locker is *in this space* – you may **Spawn 1 Puppet** or Relocate **1 Puppet** to your space to gain **card A**.

Finally, you may **Move the Locker 2 spaces** or **Relocate the Lamp to any tile**.

# 836
*I don't know what we expected.*

*The death ray finally hits us. A split second of light, heat, and pain, and then it's over.*

- Your Dreamer suffers **4** `damage` or **gain 2 Flaws**.

# 837
*The reaper once again swings its powerful, heavy scythe – the shadow of death sweeps over our heads for a moment. This time, we seize our opportunity 
and shove it with all our might. It tries to regain its balance on the edge of the platform, teetering for what feels like an eternity to us... But the giant scythe unbalances it, and the monster finally topples into the abyss, silent until the very end.*

*So, is it over? We look down into the cosmic void. But just below the platform is something much bigger – it's our planet. We see destroyed cities, burned forests, dry seas – everything turned to desert. Tall buildings bear the marks of big teeth that devoured everything that was once close to us. We don't want to return to such a world...*

# 838
*We've been chasing something for so many years.*

*Do we think that one day we will finally reach it? What price are we willing to pay? Do we even know what we are chasing? Maybe we had it all the time – within ourselves. Maybe our payment is always made with this secret something from within, sacrificing part of it each time to chase fleeting shadows.*

*What is the truth and why do we live, what is the purpose of all these lifetimes? Nobody will answer us. But if we're honest with ourselves, we do know it, and deep down we have always known.*

*Try to find it in yourself. That's why you first went through the gate in this strange game, that's why you set out on an expedition and finally ended up here. Remember why you are here and you'll be able to return to your forgotten home.*

# 839
*Neither we nor the sail are prepared for this manoeuvre. The boom hits us, sending us reeling and making us see stars!*

**Choose one:**

- Spend **3** `yellow`. 

**OR**

- Suffer **1** `damage` and discard **all** cards from your hand.

Don't discard the **current Turn card**.

- Reveal **card F**.

- Place **1** `marker` on the **0 slot** of the **Risk track**.

# 841
*To reach our goal, we must move on. However, our saucer does not work — we can only beg the giants sitting around the table not to eat us yet and to help us travel onwards.*

*The price is always the same. "And what do you have for me in exchange for my help, little people? Because I'm still ravenous. Give me more food..."*

*To appease the hunger of your hosts, you must give them something of your own. But remember that you may lose it forever!*

- **Draw 2 cards**.

# 844
*Aha, there's something really interesting. There's so much lumber down there! Maybe we could jump down.*

- If you don't, gain **1** `gem` or **draw 2 cards**.

# 846
*Bing bong! The doorbell rings, and we hear the shuffling of heavy steps and clumsy movements.*

*"I'm back. I'm tired, and I'm not in the mood. You'd better not tease me... It's just fatigue, ok? Why all these questions?!"*

- Reveal **tile W (Box Knight)** and **Spawn Box Knight** unless it's already in the Dreamscape.

# 847
*"Don't get in my way. Buzz off! Are you playing the hero?"*

- You may suffer **1 more** `damage` to *chase away* the shadow – the child will return home safely. Unfortunately, there is no reward.

*No reward? So, is it worth the risk at all?*

- Otherwise, the shadow will take the child. Where to? **Nobody will ever know.**

# 848
*In one smooth motion, we rip off the actor's mask. Rows of lamps light up, and we see that we are standing on a stage, and there are dozens of delighted people before us. They rise to their feet in a standing ovation, and the deafening applause comes from every balcony, every chair, and even from behind doors. It was a play all along...*

*We look at the actor who played the devil with relief – he stands up and bows. A wide smile adorns his face. The second player comes out from the wings – it's the protege – and also takes off his mask before bowing as well.*

*They look identical, like twins. No one died, no one murdered anyone. The only thing that ended was this play – and soon, another will begin.*

*So truly, Shakespeare had it right: "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players." We can't wait to watch the next play, to discover its story.*

*We grab the silver crank and turn it to close the curtain. It moves slowly and squeaks solemnly.*

***Ship's log 09***. 

*I don't know what I was hoping for. I am approaching the end of my journey, a boundary where nothing exists at all. There is nothing further, and the giants' orbits are so infinitely far for any human.*

*It is dark and empty. My body is barely functioning – hallucinations, breathing difficulties, hair falling out, skin peeling off. I lost my sense of taste... Humans are still miserable animals, ordinary, primitive organisms, whose place is on Earth, among its small earthly affairs. It is not our time yet for the stars.*

*The barrier of the Solar System is our test, which for a long time will remain far beyond our capabilities. For us, the cosmos turns out to be only a deadly void that will greedily devour its victims.*

- Each Dreamer suffers **1** `damage` or **gains 1 Flaw**.

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`.

- Gain **1 Hour**.

- Cross out the number on the **"Reading the Ship's log"** and write a new one: **"070."**

this is a `night` space, place 1 `threat` in this space (max. 1 `threat` per space).

# 852
*"I don't like this. I don't want to eat it."*

Nothing happens – take back this card.

# 854
*It's a page ripped from a book. The engraving shows a decorative object, probably a mirror. Well, it may prove useful.*

- Gain **card D**.

# 855
*A sudden gale causes a wave to swell. We slide up the water, toward the stars – we're so close to them we could reach out... In the distance, to the east, we see a still, huge wave looming over an observatory.*

# 856
*Green fog blankets the streets and the dirty brick walls are braided with pipes like rusty vines. We're in the Pipe District – you can't fall lower. Many who couldn't find their place in the megacity paradise above, giving up the struggle for a more dignified life, now settle this area. Like rats, they roam in the shadow of the gates, hugging its walls, afraid of contact with the light. They are happy to buy back any waste from the Dream Factory.*

*We put masks on our faces to make the stench more tolerable. Somewhere here lies the thing we came for.*

*"When you see **IT**, you will know that it is what I'm look for. You must understand, someone with my social position can't go to such horrible a place. Hurry up because I need **THIS** very much. And as soon as I get **THIS**, *the Silver Key* will be yours," the Moon Baroness says, pointing to the drawer of her desk.*

*So on the evening of that same day, we arrived here.*

# 857
*A countless variety of gates are scattered throughout the Endless City – and not just simple, wooden doors or metal gates to yards, but strange, exotic gates. Portals to hidden places, different planes of existence, or other times such as tomorrow, or your first date. But after much searching, we find a trace of what we are looking for – gates to the lower layers of dreams. This could be it. A passage was allegedly discovered twenty years ago in... The Allotments. Really?*

# 858
*We thought that a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere was good for efficiency. Well, we were wrong. It was far too casual and too nice. We have now reinstated control procedures and disciplined workers. This isn't a club, it's a factory!*

- Move `marker` to the **gray space** of the **Workers track.**

- If the **Union Leader** is *already revealed* – it's over, [resolve] -> (157)

If the **Union Leader** is *not revealed*, reveal **card B** and **Spawn the Union Leader** (use the Masked Man).

# 860
*The right dose – effective and risk-free. The heart is back to normal, happily beating again and driving the Mill. The swamp resumes its rapid growth, devouring the land. Director Pig also rewards us with a few barrels of mud – though it's inconvenient to travel with them, so we surreptitiously dispose of them as soon as we're out of sight.

# 862
*Pens, pencils, blank pages – such simple, mundane objects, but they enable the incomprehensible powers of creation. With a simple pencil, you can create an amazing world that no one has ever imagined before. You can write a letter that will affect someone's life forever, or jot down an idea that will change the world.*

Each player may imagine what could be written in the book, and then write a paragraph or make a drawing. Will you see what you can create? When you're ready, [**see for yourself**] -> (764)

Remember that ***not*** everything you create must be positive.

You may also put the utensils away and not risk anything.

# 864
*"What a surprise! I'm pleased."*

# 865

# 866
*Let's look at this dream...*

*The alarm clock howls like a mad beast, the whole bedroom shakes, and pictures fall from the wall. There is a gray world outside the window, it's almost dawn. Legs and arms feel like rubber, and it's difficult even to hit the snooze button. Eyes focus slowly under heavy lids and start seeing the surroundings. Work at the factory calls. Where's the uniform...?*

*Rating: No, no, no. This is junk, a complete no-hoper. Don't let it happen again! Nobody wants such mundane dreams. If all dreams were like that, nobody would bother to dream!*

- Each Dreamer **Seals 1 card**.

# 867
*Oh yeah, we can finally rest for a while on a comfortable chair... Take a load off, that's better.*

**Choose 1:**

– Cure **2** `damage`.

– **Unflip all Progress cards**.

– **Unseal 5 cards**.

– Remove **1 Flaw**.

# 868
*It's over for us here. We meet lamps or lockers like this outside. Sometimes they greet us with glazed smiles but more often than not they are full of spite, gloomy and hostile. Each of them has their own basements and storages, full of painful memories and mementos. Everyone pines for something.
Happiness is transient - grief and sadness await over the next horizon.*

<u>***Victory.***</u> Each Dreamer cures **2** `damage` or **Unseals 2 cards.**

# 869
*We hear thunderous footsteps – even the walls tremble. The mud rises abruptly and floods everything. Is this the end?*

*But let us start from the beginning. In moments such as these, time stops, and you can sometimes trace all the stages that led you to this point. So let's go back a few hours.*

*We saw the hatch to this basement for the first time in the house full of cockroaches. There was also a newspaper warning about coming down here. We didn't listen.*

*We walked down the winding stairs for hours, the walls becoming more and more decayed and wet. Finally, the stairs ended. A maze of brick corridors stretched in every direction, but there was no hint of dry floor – only an ocean of rusty-coloured mud. In the dark distance, we saw a shipwreck cracked in half, protruding from a sea of mud. A ship? Does this mean that we need to know how to sail? Well, nobody said it would be easy.*

*That's how it all started.*

- Place a `block` token on the **"Change course" action** on **Bl**.

# 870
Do you meet the **specific conditions** from the Train card (if there are any)? If **yes**, read on.

*The monotonous clackety-clack noise of the train puts us to sleep. It's like a journey between one dream and another, interrupted by short episodes of waking. It's funny because the **Insomnia district** appears on the station list. What else is on this list? Water Tower... Eternal City... Some Laboratory... Horizon... Somebody wakes us up when we get there.*

*The beast has been immobilized and slowly falls into her strange dream again... Scavengers scatter aimlessly, trying to salvage anything in the empty ruins – without success, obviously. It's over. At least for a while.*

*And then, something strange happens in the wasteland.*

*Green grass emerges from the dust, dunes disperse, layer by layer, revealing the old buried city. The destruction disappears as if the city was healing its wounds. Even the Scavengers begin to evolve, gradually turning back into real people. Does time run backwards? Or is it just we who are withdrawing like ghosts, coming back from a gloomy vision of the future? I think we've changed something. I hope for the better.*

*After a while, there is no trace of the dark, devoured, and dead world – only a few silver chain links to keep the memory alive in our minds.*

# 876

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether` or cures **2** `damage`.

# 880

- Cure **2** `damage`.

- Pay **5** `red` – if you can't, suffer **1** `damage` and discard **all** Keys.

*Everything matches – it's not a bident or a quadent, but a trident. The letters are also correct – not "ABC" or "XYZ", but "ISS". There is a strong
connection. But between what? What is the "four" of this "two" plus "two" addition? It's still a mystery. We have to make a note.*

- Each Dreamer may **Unseal 1 chosen card**.


# 887
*Oh? We have an engine now? It's revving high and then suddenly dies.*

- [Forget it and go to the oars] -> (756)

- [Try to start it with the choke open] -> (931)

- [Try to start it with the choke closed] -> (602)

- Each Dreamer cures **1** `damage`.

# 889
*"Now, look!"*

*The creature jumps away, revealing the view outside the window. We were sure that there was nothing more above, and yet – we see roofs bathed in the setting sun and shiny gates whirling like fallen stars. Behind one gate we can see only the blue sky and white clouds, behind another – darkness and stairs leading down.*

*The third gate... No, we must not look that way. What we see beyond the corner of our eyes is just too scary. A sea of stars and floating debris... It's unlikely we'll ever decide to go there. We quickly look away.*

*The creature croaks in disgust and returns to playing with its puppets. The silver strings remind us of cables – they also connect to the puppets' heads.*

# 890
*A week has gone by since we passed through the rift. Nights last much longer than days here, the thick fog obscures everything. The city is huge, like an endless maze. Nothing here is ordinary. We stay in bizarrely decorated hotels and fortunately nobody asks for payment. Ironically we don't have to sleep at all and we spend our spare time planning our next forays and learning about the locals. We've felt no hunger since the beginning of our time here and even though we've tasted the strange foods, have gathered no nourishment from them.

*There are some issues that plague us from time to time – sometimes our legs refuse to obey, becoming jelly-like at the worst possible moment; sometimes our mouths fuse together like that horror scene from an old film (what was it?!) and sometimes our belongings mysteriously vanish into thin air only to reappear some time later.*

*The buildings here also have a mind of their own - we leave a room and when we come back, it's different. Additional doors have appeared, sometimes new buildings pop up outside the window. People we meet sometimes transform before our eyes, their faces shifting from feature to feature, occasionally changing into someone familiar but not exactly placeable. The sensation of deja-vu occurs very commonly here.*

*A double-decker taxi stops next to the old, closed market with a sign that reads: "Everything for free! But only at the highest prices!" Questioning a few of the strange locals in the area we managed to gain enough cryptic information to know that the one we are seeking - who might be able to help us answer a few questions about this strange city - disappeared a few days ago in this old run down marketplace.*

*The taxi driver thanks us and drives away without taking payment. We wonder why the driver spends her days chauffeuring lost souls around. Perhaps like Sisyphus they are compelled into an eternity of toil.*

*We easily sneak through a hole in a rusty chain-link fence and start investigating, trying to find clues in the impenetrable darkness...*

- Whenever you run out of `block` tokens during this Dream and you have to place one, take the `block` token from the furthest `night` space from your Dreamer.

-***HINT*** -  What do your Dreamers have that will allow you to illuminate the darkness? Also pay attention to the flavour text dotted around the map tiles!

- **EXTRA HINT** - Remember that one of your basic actions is to **PEEK**. It may come in handy!

Also remember that there are special rules on the **back of the Dream Gate Tile**. In this case - "**Assault 5** `red` will allow you to discard **1** `threat`.

# 891
*Yawn, when will it finally arrive?*

*Oh, a pretty pebble! I'll take it, it may be useful. It's so warm...*

- Gain **1** `gem`.

*Will I be able to hit that can? Let's try. Oops! Sorry!*

*Ah, the bus has arrived!*

- Relocate your Dreamer to **A4** to the space with the *bus stop sign*.

# 893
*"I dream about the taste of moonshine. Did you know that these are real tears caught from the moon goddess Artemis, after she was tricked into killing her lover Orion?*

*Would you join me for a while? I wouldn't recommend such a sad thing, but I am from another world, as you can see, and I don't know how to get back to my family. I don't know why I am here when they are there. The only way to cope is to drink."*

You may discard **1** `gem` to discard the top card of your Influence deck. If the colour of Intent of this card is:

– `yellow` = *If there's so much sadness in one place, there has to be hope and joy elsewhere.* You may reshuffle your deck (without penalty).

– `red` = *A drop of moonshine lands on my skin – despair grasped my heart.* - You suffer **1** `damage`.

– `green` = *Luna's tears hold more than just sadness. When we drink them, we are granted a ray of moonlight.* - Gain **1** `ether`.

If this card has several colors, pick any one of them.

# 894
*A humongous, pale head appears in the darkness, and the rest of the body follows it after a while. The creature is covered in muck and splutters:*

*"There you are... Give me back my face. You won't need it anymore. Time to wake up."*

- Each Dreamer *reshuffles* their deck. Then, any 1 Dreamer must return any 1 of their Masks to the Mask Pool (and return its Mask card to the Secrets) **OR** each Dreamer returns **1 random Influence card** from their deck to the Influence Market.

<u>***Failure.***</u>. 

- Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets. Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream - you can still come back here to try again.

- Add **tile II-37 Y (Pearl Hunter)** to the Slumber deck.

- Change the Season to **Season of Plague**.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers on `start` spaces.

*There it is – the cradle of the nightlife, where the lights never dim, and the entertainment never ends. According to the rumors, vampires originated from here. They feed on blood, of course, but also red wine, pain, anger, envy, and fear. If we are not careful enough, we could be eaten alive here.*

# 899

- Reveal **card A**.

- You may discard **1** `gem` to gain **1 Hour**.

# 901
*Memories can be difficult and dark, as well as sunny and soothing. They are like medicines - some poison us, others can heal. The art of moving within them is no less valuable than the art of walking on the ground in this world.*

*Sunny days, picnic on the edge of the forest. But I remember the maze in the garden the most.*

*We stand in a queue to get into the park, the sun is burning in the sky, a light pleasant breeze soothes the stinging heat. We go through the gate. What can I say - it's beautiful here. It has always been.*

*Well... If it weren't for these darned dogs.*


# 902
*It's time to go. The city still has a lot to offer, but we'll probably come back more than once. Even though we're tired to the bone, we know we experienced too little to be satiated and there's a niggling fear that we'll miss out on too much while we're gone.*

You may now spend **all unspent Settled Business tokens**. In the following list, there are things you may buy (spend everything because what you don't spend will be discarded):

- **1** `threat` = Each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`. 
- **1** `threat` = Each Dreamer **Unseals 1 chosen card**.
- **1** `threat` = **Restore 1 Item**.
- **3** `threat` = Gain **1 Key**.
- **6** `threat` = Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.
- **8** `threat` = Gain **1 new random Item** from the **Item Market**.

A beautiful vehicle shines at a display - you may survey it carefully. Peek at **card D (Speeder)**. You may spend **10** `threat` to gain it.

<u>***Victory.***</u> Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.

- Restore 3 Shopping cards **(II-41 C)**.

- Change the Season to **Ordinary Days**.

- Discard the current Dreamscape. Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets.

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream - you can still come back here to try again. Remember that the **Eternal City Dream hides a secret Dream Gate tile** - if you haven't found it already, your campaign may get stuck.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 905
*If you don't know where to go, you've run out of money, are in trouble with the law or just plain old tired of everything - the Sanctuary is a place you should go. Here, you'll find peace, silence and a little bit of luxury - all of this for a voluntary donation.*

*Of course, with more generous donations, more interesting floors and rooms will be open to you.*

- Each Dreamer **Unseals 4 cards**.

- You may return **1 random Item** from the Storage to the **Item Market** to **Unseal all cards** of **all** Dreamers.

- You may discard **3** `gem` to cure **3** `damage`.


# 906
*Step after step... Rubble cracks under our shoes. We've been here for an hour and within that time everything has changed beyond recognition. The entrance was actually inconspicuous - just a crack in the building under renovation. Then as we entered, the narrow concrete corridor turned several times. One of the doors led to a much longer hall, ending in a steel gate. Through there, things changed considerably again. We passed several offices which hadn't been used for years, an old theatre, dilapidated toilets, long dark corridors and pipes - and then we knew that we were in the middle of the Endless Basements. So, we finally found this place...*


# 908
*Don't think too much, they say. We blow on the sail. By the power of our magnificent breath, the sail is repaired in seconds. After a while, we start to cough something up - a piece of crystallized air.*

- Gain **1** `gem`.

Discard the current **Turn card**.


# 909
*I can't do it anymore... I need more strength. But I have to go on! It is important!*

- You may suffer **2** `damage` to gain **card H**.


# 910
***Ship's log 05.*** 

*I'm still alive, but what's next? What about Alice? What about my family? Did anyone die? Has anyone survived?*

*What if I am completely alone now?*

*I am still drifting through space. There is silence, but it's deeper than just the absence of sound. It is like an emptiness of the soul, of my very thoughts. Like death.*

*Or maybe I didn't escape? Maybe it didn't work out and the ship was torn to shreds? Or maybe we didn't lift off at all? Crashes sometimes occur during the launch... perhaps all that remain are the debris of my rocket lying in the field on the spaceport - my unconscious soul wandering in space?*

*No matter, right now I travel the cosmos - I see the ocean of stars and slowly approach the Moon.*

*Except that I don't see any orbital station. It's not on the radar. No signal, no trace. Everything indicates that it was destroyed. What now?*

*Turn back or set a new course? But it will be months or years of inert flight. I may survive, but what then?*

*I calculate a new course, enter the coordinates of the orbits of subsequent planets. I can succeed. My rocket will move away and then turn around Jupiter using its gravity as a slingshot. This manoeuvre will take... two years. And another two back. No one has ever made such a flight.*

*I have enough oxygen, food, and water but I know that's not all I need to survive. But it can succeed.*

*The decision is made. I change course. Space awaits...*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`.

- Gain **1 Hour**.

- Cross out the number on the **"Reading the Ship's log"** and write a new one: **"261"**.


# 911
*We lift the crate effortlessly.*

Do you have the **Real Treasure card**?

- [**Yes**] -> (223).

- **No** - *The crate grows lighter and lighter in our arms, in the end lifting us up and away, above the port, above the city, above our worries...* - Relocate *all* Dreamers to the `start` space, each Dreamer cures **1** `damage`.


# 912
*It is said that photos do not lie. Well actually they do - very often they cut out important details, are taken out of context and represent an unnatural moment that is too properly framed and posed.*

*This pile of photos represents one life. Images frozen in time appear sequentially, some soothing, others disturbing or worse. We should let some of them disappear forever. Everything is mixed up - truth with lies, different periods of time, or places. We have some work to do here - it's time to tidy it all up and put it back in the silver box.*

The photographs are cruelly cut and mixed up. Each of the **nine** photos is represented mainly by **1 card/tile** - which contains the biggest part of the photograph along with condition **"Only if this photo is fully visible."** When performing the **Rearranging Photos action**, pick up one of these cards/tiles and place it ***over*** other cards.

A Photo on a card/tile is delimited by its **black frame**. If a space contains the ***slightest fragment*** of a photo (frame included), then it is part of that photo and this space must be empty in order to move that card/tile at the top of the card pile.

And one more thing! In this Dream, some small fragments of spaces on the cards/tiles aren't marked as **blocked spaces** (the rules for blocked spaces are explained in the rulebook but in this case, they will be bent a little). You must decide on your own if the visible part of a space is large enough to place your Dreamer. Maybe you will decide that ***a tiny fragment is sufficient***?


# 913
*It's a drink in a corked bottle. Nobody ever opened it. The label says: "Drink me." And in smaller letters: "If you don't drink me, you're a loser." Can we trust labels? Probably not, but anyway...*

- You may suffer **1** `damage` to **draw 4 influence cards**.


# 915
*The chains are at their limits when the beast tries to break free. You think this is the best moment to pull the lever, strain the chains even more and try to immobilize the creature...*

You may try to end this now or to wait a little more in order to repair more Chains. Remember - the more Chains you place on the Dreamscape, the higher the chance of your success will be (and lower the chance of losing your sacrificed cards for nothing). 

**Decide now.**

You may roll the **Luck die** (the success depends on the **number of Chains** on the Dreamscape):

- `luck-x` = [Unfortunately, it didn't work!] -> (297).

- `luck-blank` = [**If 4 Chains are in place**] -> (497). [Otherwise] -> (297).

- `luck-1`/`luck-2`/`luck-3` = [**if the result is lower than the number of placed Chains**] -> (497). [**If equal or more**] -> (297).


# 917
*We see military equipment from the last war with the Moon, stuffed dinosaur remains that were recently found in the Eternal City mines, an exhibition of retro consoles, as well as original journals of ancient poets and dreamers. They can be read on-site using special mechanical arms with pliers. We could live in this museum forever and we wouldn't get bored for a long time. Finally, morning comes, and our ticket expires. After leaving, we see the city around us with new eyes.*

- Relocate any **3 Businesses** to any spaces (max. 1 Business per space).


# 919
*Wet soil often hides treasures, and this time it is no different. In the shadows of the guard booth, a freshly-made hole gapes. Someone even left the shovel there! We dig for some time, just to find that the only thing here is wasted time.*

Add 1 Turn.


# 921
*Unfortunately, there are no cleats on this ship.*

- You may spend **2** `red` to discard the current **Turn card.**

Otherwise, nothing happens.


# 922
***Not good, not good at all.***

It's not a problem this time, but in the following Dreams, the effect can be painful.

- But now, each Dreamer cures **all** `damage` - discards **all** `damage` markers back to the `damage` **pool**. You're determined and healthy again.

And you've just discovered that you're inside a tutorial and nothing bad can happen to you, no matter what anyone says! But you probably knew that all along...

# 923
*This part of the city seems off - the air carries a whiff of something bad, a hint of oncoming personal disaster. Nothing ends well here. Our heads become even heavier, filled with sombre, unpleasant thoughts.*


# 925
*These are all great tips, and I've read them all hundreds of times. But as usual, there is no advice on how to start to implement them. Another book that might improve us, but we lack the motivation to listen to it. Well, maybe a little bit. Perhaps another seed has been sown.*

- Each Dreamer on **B4 Unseals** or **Unflips 1 card**.


# 927
*The butcher takes the goods and smells them thoroughly.*

*"Okay, I might be able to use this. If you have anything else, you know where to find me."*

**Choose 1:**

- \- Gain **3 Keys** and **3 new random Items** from the **Item Market**.
- \- Each Dreamer rolls the **Luck die**:

  - `luck-x`/`luck-blank` = Gain **2** `gem`

  - `luck-1` = Gain **1** `ether`.

  - `luck-2` = Gain **2** `ether`. 

  - `luck-3` = Gain **3** `ether` or **1 random card from the Influence Market** for *free*.

# 928
*Look!" The beggar picks up a rag from the ground and wraps her head with it.*

*"Can you recognize me now? No - that's the answer. I'm not me, I'm someone else! It's a real mystery, a true secret - keep it to yourself."*

- You may discard your **Mask** to **Unseal 10 cards**.


# 929
*We haven't been here for so long!*

*We know every pebble here, every tree, every blade of grass. Have we ever lived here? It is all so familiar and close to me...*

- Remove **all 6 Silver Key cards** from the game.


# 931
*It seems that we flooded the engine. It will be useless for a long time.*

- Place the current **Turn card** at the *bottom* of the **Turn deck**.


# 932
*After enduring many hardships, we have been able to uncover the entrance to the school. The war still goes on and we are left wondering how many we could have saved... Even one more little life is important.*

*This one life, buried under the rubble of a school behind a huge spider web that is so difficult to remove. The situation is very dangerous especially when the big spiders are still around, hunting without mercy.*

<u>***Victory.***</u> Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`. Each Dreamer cures **1** `damage` or **Unseals 1 card**.

- Gain **card G (All valuable things)**.

- Restore 3 Shopping cards **(II-41 C)**.

- Change the Season to **Ordinary Days**.

- Add **all** Items and Influence cards of this Dream that you did not gain to the Item / Influence Market.

- Gain **tile II-40 C ("Hope died at last" Dream Gate tile)**.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers on `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 934
**Hint 2**: 

- You have the word already, right? If you have, try to guess the code from numbers that are left. The order of colours of the lettered blocks should help you.


# 935
*We are successful, our trap works! The Water Lord falls into the slush and begins to drown, yelling in fear.*

*That's weird. Why is it afraid of its own domain?*

- ***Try to help it*** - each Dreamer **Seals 3 cards** to [resolve] -> (11). Is it a good idea though?

**OR**

- [***Let it drown***] -> (582).


# 936
*Through a ruined door, we enter a dark, stinking room. It comes to our mind that such a place would be the perfect lair of a wild beast. As soon as we pick up the first object that lay on one of the stone shelves (a strange figure of a one-eyed god?), the creature appears in the doorway.*

- Gain **card D**.

- Relocate the **Scarecrow** to your space.


# 937
[If **tile X** is *revealed*] -> (363).

[If *not*] -> (221).


# 938
*The electric creature seizes the boat along with the child - soon, the creature and its prey disappear into the storm clouds. We can't do anything to stop it.*

- Discard the **Personal token (the Kid)** and return **card D (Kid in a boat)** to the Secrets of this Dream.

- Discard the **Entity** and return **card C** to the Secrets of this Dream.

- Each Dreamer **Seals 3 cards** or suffers **1** `damage`.


# 939
*"It's common knowledge - but even if it's widely known, it doesn't mean that everyone must have heard about it. So, here's a tidbit just for you - the northern storm often prizes its victims with wonderful treasures."*

- Gain **1** `gem`.


# 940
*The tall man has had enough. We have no chance to hurt him in any way, but we manage to tire him enough to escape and that's a victory in our books.*

This Slumber ends.

- Return this Slumber tile to the Secrets.

- Add **tile II-37 W (Tall Man)** to the Slumber deck.


# 941
*It is unexpected. Instead of falling into water or landing on a swinging chest, we fall onto sharp rocks, hurting ourselves painfully.*

- Discard **1** `gem` or suffer **1** `damage`.

- Reveal **tile Y**.

- Relocate to any space on **B3**.


# 942
*The door is open and it's silent inside. We enter carefully. An old man sits on a bed, completely faceless - his head looks like a plaster ball wrapped in a rag. He stares at the white noise flashing on the TV screen.*

*An umbrella and a whole bunch of different masks are suspended on the hanger by the door. Maybe some of them belong to us?*

- You may **Restore your Mask.**


# 943
*To go down, we have to go higher and higher up the shaky steps. The darkness becomes so impenetrable that it hurts our eyes.*

- Reveal **tile Y**.


# 944
*The slightly calmed cockroach crawls into a hole in the wall. We examine the object she handed us before she left.*

- Place a `block` token on **Check the wardrobe action** on **B2 tile**.

- Reveal **card G**.


# 945
*A quiet girl sits on the couch with her head bowed, her shoulders slumped. A furious woman, probably her mother, walks across the room. Monstrous anger boils under her skin, ready to erupt at any moment. But then the mother catches a glimpse of the beautiful moonlight outside the window and for a moment, she forgets about what angered her in the first place. When she turns back she truly sees her daughter for the first time in a long time.*

- Settle any **2 Businesses** from any spaces.


# 946
*This street animates simple objects into something alive, something more than alive. In our world, things also came alive sometimes - mainly, just before their 'death' - before being thrown away. An old beloved car after buying a new one. A trusty backpack. An old apartment full of memories. Even a favourite t-shirt.*

*This crate isn't a simple crate. We shouldn't place our dirty hands on its delicate, wooden skin right away - it would be rude. So, we speak with it for a moment and finally manage to work things out. And what do we find inside?*

Do you have the **Real Treasure card**?

- [**Yes**] -> (223).
- [**No**] -> (387).


# 947
*The ocean is always beautiful - sometimes as still as a picture, sometimes full of awe-inspiring power. But here, we find a festering wound - heaps of rubbish floating on the water, spilling their oily blood that taints the once-pure waters. There's no life in here, this ocean is dead. It's not a place we want to cross on foot.*

- Relocate 1 Dreamer from this tile to any other space on the other side of this tile's Wall.


# 949
*Really nice. Great job. The rainbow after the squall is so beautiful that we find something shining brightly inside it.*

- Gain **1** `gem`.

Discard the current **Turn card**.


# 950
*When time stops, we feel lonely, even in a crowded room. There is no escape from this state.*

*Another dying house, another withering life, more messed up photos, forgotten chairs on which no one is sitting anymore, dirty basements full of forlorn memories, empty and stinking rooms... Only the clock is still alive, ruthlessly chewing at the oncoming hours and days.*

*"Did you forget who I used to be?" The Locker asks bitterly.*

*The barely glowing Lamp nods sadly with its lampshade.*

*"And you forgot that nobody cares today? It's your fault, you've never admitted it."*

*"You aren't innocent either, better look in the mirror," the Locker responds before shutting its doors for good.*


# 951
*It works, the key fits! We open the wooden door and go inside...*

*We are in a small room with walls painted blue. Cobwebs run across the room like curtains. Nobody has been here for a long time. We stumble over empty cans and boxes littering the floor.*

*There are several plush toys lying on a dirty bed: a teddy bear, a doll with a broken arm, a puppet with a long beard... but taking any of them is impossible because someone sewed them to the mattress.*

*We look around for a moment, but there's actually nothing here. Disappointed, we leave, closing the door behind us...*

[Resolve] -> (268).


# 952
*The four-story block stretches along the streets endlessly, colourful window lights create a mosaic in the night landscape. The yellow light of street lamps tints stone pavements and trees are rustled by a light breeze. It's so peaceful...*

*And yet, as soon as we look more closely, we notice the shadows hiding in the nooks and back alleys: a cinder of a cigarette in a doorway, a choked scream in the distance, the tangible fear of a child returning home too late or the shuffling of a sick dog who has not yet lost hope of finding a new human owner.*

If you could **help** here, what would you choose?

- \- **Defend the kid**, because a shadow suddenly blocks their path - [suffer **1** `damage` and resolve] -> (847).

- \- Look through a window into an apartment where **something bad is happening** - [**Seal 2 cards** and resolve] -> (945).

- \- Pet the **old dog** - [gain **1 Flaw** and resolve] -> (190).


# 953
*The docks are at the edge of Here and There. Sometimes someone goes There, rarely someone or something arrives Here.*

*When we try looking far away, toward the horizon, we see only fog. It obscures the view, but also the distant truth. There are things described in many leaflets around the docks - but are these notes true? Maybe someday we will see it for ourselves.*

*Everything is vague and unclear, bizarre and ambiguous. And there are wardens who ensure things stay this way.*

*The fog thins a little, revealing wet cobblestone. It's night - as always.*

*Phew, we made it again. We are slowly losing strength, but now the stakes are higher. The lighting has changed - torches now burn in the Arena, and smoke obscures visibility in many places. We are currently watched by over a thousand viewers. Let's show them what we got!*

- Each Dreamer may **Seal 4 cards** to cure **2** `damage`.

- Resolve the **top card** from the **Arena Fate deck** (remember to add 1 Dreamscape Slumber Map tile!).

- Resolve the **top Slumber tile** from the **Arena Slumber deck**, but add **4 Morphings** during its setup.

- If you don't achieve Victory in that Slumber, end your **Arena cycle** and resolve **Awakening**.

- \- [End your Arena cycle and claim your reward] -> (287).

- \- Move the `marker` on the Dream Gate tile to the next slot, following the arrows, and resolve the script displayed in the slot you just reached.


# 955
*The lonely character sits in a beaten-up rocking chair and slowly falls asleep.*

*"They did not come. Every day is the same. Although... something has changed. Is winter approaching slowly? I like winter... It's already dark. I'll watch TV for a while, and then I should go to sleep. Maybe they will come tomorrow?..."*

- Add **tile II-37 H (Faceless Creeps)** to the Slumber deck if it's not there already.

- Add **card K (Downtime)** to the **Flaws deck**.

- Change the Season to **Season of Watchers**.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers on `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 956
*"Is it the deserter wanted by William?" the sock aide-de-camp asks his superior.*

*The captain looks that way, squinting suspiciously. Then, he bites into a juicy sandwich and says, with his mouth full,*
*"We'll deal with it in a moment. I'll just finish this sandwich first."*

*We interrupt, asking what time it is. Both soldiers frantically take their watches out, heavy chains dangle from their pockets. "It's midnight. Oh." "Right, it's getting late... I have to wake up early - I have to climb to the Arena, I need to be in good shape. It's time for us to gooooooo!"*

- You may discard **1** `ether` to Block 1 Step on the current **Turn card**.


# 958
*It's good that not all of the area is under marsh water - there's even a patch of dry ground. Unfortunately, the rest doesn't help me too much, and what's worse, I have a feeling of strange guilt that I wasted my time so unproductively.*

*The tree under which I have wasted these few moments seems to smile sadly.*

- Discard **all** cards from hand, but you may reshuffle your **Influence deck**.


# 959
*The sky parts like a curtain, the clouds fold, wrinkles appear, starlight distorts... We can't describe what we see beyond the curtain. The strange anomaly draws closer, devours us, and spits us beyond the vast ocean.*

- Relocate this tile (with all Dreamers and tokens on it) to **any empty tile slot** in the Dreamscape.


# 961
*An alarm sounds, a red light flashes, the siren howls deafeningly. Sturdy steel gates rise... There's a room on the other side.*

- Flip **tile Y** face-up.


# 964
Each Dreamer checks their **drawing**:

- \- If there is a **tree** - cure **1** `damage`.

- \- If there is a **human character** - **Unseal 5 cards**.

- \- If there are **some human figures** - **Unseal 5 cards**.

- \- If there is a **chimney** - gain **1** `gem`. 

- \- If there is a **window** - **reshuffle** your **Influence deck**.

Then, **all** Dreamers choose the ***most peaceful drawing*** - its author gains **card I (Ghost of a friend)**. You have 1 minute to choose the drawing. If you can't agree on which drawing to pick, add this card to the **Influence Market**.

Finally, discard **card F** to the Secrets of this Dream and `block` the **"Nice drawings" action** on **tile Z**.


# 965
*We can't move, the cocoon is tightly knotted, the strands are sturdy. We can't see anything more than gray cobwebs around.*

Each Dreamer gains **1 Flaw**.

**Choose 1:** 

- \- *We struggle, despite the risk of drawing the spiders' attention* - each Dreamer suffers **1** `damage` or **Seal 4 cards**, then goes back on the Dreamworld Map.

- \- [*We wait*] -> (20).


# 966
*We wonder if this chest belongs to someone. But let's just take a look...*

*Inside, we find an extremely useful pipe. We look through it - and see a completely different place on the other end. The inscription on the pipe says: "There is a way out of every situation. There is a path to every goal. You just have to find it."*

*This is a pipe for fast movement in the Pipe District! It will be useful to us, it's better than a sports car here.*

- Reveal **card B**.


# 969
*This is too much. The exhausted hull gives up and, with a deft moan, breaks in half. The airship quickly begins to sink in a sea of clouds. Finally, it rests at its bottom - now debris scattered across green fields. Another mark on the long list of Icarus.*

<u>***Failure.***</u> 

- Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets. 

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream - you can still come back here to try again.

- Each Dreamer **Seals 10 cards**.

- Change the Season to **Season of Emptiness**.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 970
*Sometimes, when someone needs help, we'll offer aid. Of course, not always, but we try. It also depends on who needs help.*

*There is a strange figure submerged up to the waist in the swamp. It doesn't seem like she can't handle it - a camouflage uniform, a sharp weapon. And yet... You can't beat mud with your fist or knife.*

***Do we help?*** - [spend **1** `gem` or **Seal 3 cards**] -> (642).

***Or leave her.*** - *Everyone should worry about their own affairs.*


# 974
*The museum has thirty floors above ground and ten underground - each floor displays its own neon ads. There is no chance to see even a quarter of the exhibition during one day. What's more, today the special exhibition begins: "Remains of the past world. A visit to the 21st century."*

**What do you want to see?**

- \- [a bit of everything] -> (917).

- \- [The newest exhibition] -> (90).


# 975
*Any superhero would be proud of such a leap! I am on the other side. I made it!*

- Relocate your Dreamer to the `spawn` space on **B4**.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 978
*He did it! We did it! Despite the cannonade, wildfires, flying shrapnel, snipers, and obstacles, our protege achieved his goal. It wasn't really a charge because no one else was running. But he's in a safe place now, away from the front line.*

*The protege opens his bag and takes out a crumpled bundle - civilian clothes. We think he just deserted. Now, the time speeds up...*

- Add **1 Turn**.

- [**Intimidation**] -> (1145).

- [**Deception**] -> (1065).

- [**Understand**] -> (1096).

- [**Open yourself**] -> (1010).


# 982
*A stream of mud flows out here, together with lots of rubbish. Sometimes mud is valuable, other times worthless - I don't know anymore. As you can see, not all mud is the same. At one point, a pig's tail flashed there. While exploring this area, we discover a hidden path.*

- Reveal **tile W**.


# 984
*Let's look at this dream...*

*We sit around a small pond full of mud. There are huts made of mud, fences of dry grass and listless people of clay all around us. There is nothing in this world but mud and thickets. We notice something green in the gray pond but it disappears after a while. What was that? Was that something I lost? I suddenly get the sensation that something I'm looking for is out there. We begin to wallow desperately in dirty water, but all we pull out are chunks of slippery clay.*

***Rating***: *Well, it's not a dream we would like... It is somehow cheap... We need luxury goods. Try again, but try harder, okay?*

- Gain **2** `gem`.


# 985
*Strands of sadness entangle our minds, filling our heads with dullness and resentment. Can we stop this negative loop when there is no faith? Is it possible to find joy in something insignificant?*


# 987
Is the **Warden** in **range 4**?

- [**Yes**] -> (832).
- **No** - reveal **card E**.


# 988
*It looks like bait. Is this a way to fish for people? Throwing a shiny red box and waiting for someone to grab it? Is there a hidden fisherman in the darkness who likes roasted people for dinner?*

*Whatever... we already have it in our hands and open it slowly. There's a folder, book, notebook, papers... And a key!*

- Gain **1 Key**.

- You may **Seal 5 cards** or discard **1** `ether` to gain **card E** if it's available.

Then, roll the **Luck die**:

- `luck-x`/`luck-blank` = *Is it a train emerging from the darkness, or maybe a gigantic, greedy hand? We escape but only by the skin of our teeth.* Suffer **1** `damage`.


# 989
*An unsettling creature emerges from the dark waters. It could be mistaken for a snake but its head is almost human. Yet, the way it's twisted with anger strips away this resemblance. It looks at us with contempt, as if we were the source of all its problems and ills. The creature seems old, ancient even, and probably is the last member of its forgotten race. It rises into the air and crashes back into the sea creating a huge wave that sends us reeling.*

- Spend **1** `gem` or **Seal 3 cards**.


# 990
*We can't go on like this. Our thoughts cloud our minds, holding us back from doing anything. We try to look at ourselves from beyond, and we become the Observer. The weight of our thoughts falls from our shoulders and the haze of sadness disappears from before our eyes. We see now. We see everything.*

- Return the **Heavy Thoughts** card to the Secrets of this Dream.


# 992
*Without the support of the forestay, the mast collapses.*

- If any Dreamer is on the **Front Sail** or **Back Sail cards**, place them in any space on **tiles B1 or B2**. Such a Dreamer must spend **3** `yellow`, or they suffer **2** `damage`.

- Discard the **Front Sail** and **Back Sail cards** from the Dreamscape (you may place them back later with "**Set the front / back sail" actions**).

- Don't discard the current Turn card.


# 993
*It's been long enough already and we discovered nothing peculiar. A house like any other house, well-kept from the outside, but inside full of grief, anger, and regret. We can't search every home in this city, but I know that we should go to this one again maybe later. It feels like an important step in our journey.*

<u>***Failure.***</u> Return all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks) to the Secrets. 

- Keep the Dream Gate tile of this Dream - you can still come back here to try again.

- Add **tile II-37 N (Puppets)** to the Slumber deck unless it's there already.

- Change the Season to **Season of Plague**.

- Reveal the 2 Starting Slumber Map tiles and place the Dreamers in `start` spaces.

You are back on the Dreamworld Map.


# 995
*It succeeds. Immoral, but effective.*

- Discard the **Butcher**. It won't appear during this Dream again (place a `block` token on its **Entity tile**).

*We hear a child's scream: "So that's it! You are so... UGH! I'll see you again!"*

- Add **tile II-37 S (Malicious Child)** to the Slumber deck.


# 997
*"Smart, little one. Taking that from you is a reward itself. This one time - proceed."*

(I wonder, from where you've found this card - from your **deck**/**Discard pile**/**Active Progress zone**? But it doesn't matter.)

- If no Dreamer has resolved this script yet, return this **Flaw** to the **Flaw deck** and Move the Bowl to the next Checkpoint.

- If this is a **Vampire Flaw**, place it in the **Sealed cards** - (*even if the card says you cannot do that*). It's time we bend some rules.

- If any Dreamer has resolved this script already - instead of losing a **Flaw card**, gain another **Flaw**.


# 998
*The wall breaks. Subconsciously, we know that probably no one wanted to discover what lay beyond it. A void frozen in time awaits on the other side - through the looking glass to the dark corner of every soul - where the cold truth about everything and everyone lies hidden. Discovering it though would be akin to seeing the emotionless raw code - the wizard behind the curtain - instead of the beautiful illusion of the world it tried to create.*

*With resigned trepidation, we pass to the threshold of the void. Next to us, a small garden floats, spinning slowly like a weary ballet dancer pirouetting on the brink of a stage.*

*A single, ancient dead tree stands in the middle of the ruined garden, leaning over a pair of lovers. They don't move, frozen in time. They will never will never understand that they were nothing more than the imperfect transient thought of a solitary soul - that they were never born and will never die, will never lived and will never be separated. There is much beauty and ephemerality in the idea of these traces of memory decaying, haunting the present but never invoking the future.*

*We leave a dying light behind and plunge into the endless void. The only thing that still exists here is our own path - disintegrating, shaky, barely visible but definitely surmountable.*

- Remove **all 6 Silver Key cards** from the game.

# 999
*We see the light, pale and dim - it hurts our eyes after being in such deep darkness. Can it be...?*

*Can we succeed? We look around - we're now in some white room. This world is unusually gray and ordinary - we haven't seen anything like this for a long time. We try several times to use our powers - only to find that we can't. Are we finally back in the old, recovered reality? Have the dreams and nightmares finally ceased? Is everything back as it was before?*

*The images come to us - all those strange dreams that we dreamed, all those paths which finally brought us here. These memories start disappearing like smoke in the wind. We feel our memories changing, reshaping to what was before ... And the catastrophe... What catastrophe? Strange memories barely loom on the edge of oblivion - silver keys, mysterious walls and gates, scary beasts...*

*Why are we strapped to our beds in a hospital room? Was it all just madness and strange dreams? We try to move, but the belts are holding tight. Yet we are relieved to see the world around us - everything exists normally as it should. We did it...*

*What did we just do? It's hard to remember anything. We had a nightmare about the end of the world, but it was only a nightmare, we need to pull ourselves together - maybe therapy, drugs, and a long rest will help us.*

[Resolve] -> (364).


# 1000
*Spectres have always wandered this cold corridor. Human shadows - each damaged in a different way, but all incapable of existing in the real world outside.*

*Because you need to know that the spectre is a human who, deep down, has given up. They desire nothing anymore, no longer dream about anything and want to change nothing, because they know it's too late to start anything new.*

*It's a lie though. You may not be able to relive the past but you can learn to live your new life well. There is really nothing under your mask - you can be whoever you want to be any day. Each day gives us thousands of moments. Each one can be groundbreaking, different, amazing. There is much more to you than you think.*

- Gain **2 Hours** or gain **1** `ether`. 


# 1001
*I'm at home again, in my safe place where I can hide. I don't have to leave. Time doesn't exist here, and nobody can see me. I'll wait a little longer here... Just one more moment.*

*It's just a strange dream, it seems so funny in the morning. It makes me laugh - like everything around.*

- Remove **all** your Flaw cards.


# 1002
*The electric shock causes my thoughts to fade for a moment, and as my brain slowly reboots, I hear the click of the switch again - and once again, the lightning bolts rush through my mind. These are ordinary medical treatments, all to make the world whole again - because you can't live in an unstable world that is constantly shaking, where you can gain something one moment only to lose everything the next.*

*You can't live in a world where everything is so fragile.*

- Gain **1** `ether`.


# 1003
*The huge reveller turns to us.*

*"Hey, little ones, I have an idea. Let's do a contest! Listen to me..."*

**Each Dreamer may play only once:**

1. Place 1 `damage` from the `damage` pool (if there are any) in any space of **A3** on the Dreamworld Map.

2. Flick it in such a way as to make it land on any space of **C3** on the Dreamscape.

- If you succeed - **Unseal 3 cards** or Block 1 Step on the current Turn card. Discard that `damage` from the Dreamscape.

- If you don't - suffer that `damage`.

***Warning: You can't clear up the board before starting this contest.***


# 1004
*"Let me share my pain with you," the wraith whispers when we come closer.*

*It's a sunny day, we walk along the sidewalk in the city center. It's scorching hot. A shadow of a man lies on the side of the road, searing pain splitting his chest. It's nothing compared to the fear of never seeing his daughter again. He extends his hand to a passer-by.*

*"Buzz off, drunkard!" he hears our voice in response.*

- Suffer **1** `damage`. Continue the Slumber.


# 1005
*Why does this blue door still haunt us? What could be inside?*

Each player should close their eyes and, for a whole minute, imagine whatever could be *beyond the blue door*.

Then, each player should describe what they imagined.

**Choose the story that was the most moving.**

- If you [manage to choose only 1] -> (9).

- If you cannot reach an agreement - each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`.


# 1006
*Why do I still see this tunnel and the light at its end? I am not there, I am here! But why can I still feel its chill?*

*I have to run outside, soak up the sunlight. Laugh and play to forget this dark void. It's wonderful to live!*

- Gain **1** `ether`.


# 1007
*Fear overcomes the filthy degenerates at the first word we shout. They flee into cool shadows, cramming into narrow passages between dreams. They will come back, but how fast? It depends on us.*

- This Slumber ends (without Victory or Failure).


# 1008
*Some of them allow us to pass, but we see that not everyone is friendly. They also differ from each other - each of them is a different world, agreeing with one, disagreeing with the other. If we had stayed here longer, maybe we would have understood more.*

You may end this Slumber (without Victory or Failure).

- If not, continue the Slumber.


# 1009
*I've lived in hell for many years - every day was like a year without end, and each year seemed to drag on for eternity. From morning until evening, when this state of mercy was interrupted for a moment, my flexible body gradually turned into stone and steel.*

*All dreams withered in a second, like cut flowers. Only one thought gave me some strange hope - hell must end somewhere. I want to go outside, come back for only one purpose - to ruthlessly cleanse the world of evil, like the hand of fate.*

*So, it worked - I'm no longer a human being. Now I am an instrument of a higher force.*

- Cure **3** `damage` or gain **1** `ether`.


# 1010
*The masked monsters wait for our move. They make welcoming grunts and encourage us with their dirty claws to come closer. We want to approach them, but we recoil at their acidic smell. At a moment's notice, the faceless creeps can become hostile again.*

- If you don't perform any **Assault** action this Turn, Faceless Creeps won't perform any Steps this Turn. Continue the Slumber.


# 1011
*I didn't like coming to that old, decaying house. Everything here was dirty and decaying, cut off from the living world and waiting helplessly for the end. Obsolete equipment, old furniture, boring books, pitiful souvenirs - like barely-collected crumbs from the table belonging to other people's blooming lives. How was all this rubbish going to encourage anyone to visit?*

*And those pathetic pictures meant to conjure up the past when we were all together - while we still had time for it. There was a certain lonely creature in them all, who waited each day with fading hope. But I never had time.*

- You may suffer **1** `damage` to gain **1** `ether`.


# 1012
*Each of us was a specialist in our field. We have spent our entire lives in our small artificial world - the laboratory - protected from the raging and unstable worlds nearby. We spent our entire lives deepening our knowledge and exercising our willpower - all to prepare ourselves for this trip.*

*Now, it is difficult to remember which of us was actually a psychologist, physicist, or survival specialist. There seems to be little left of these memories.*

*But that's not all. Each of us had a completely different, 'normal' life before the cataclysm happened. This old life, and the tragedies we experienced in them, allowed us to accumulate the enormous energy necessary to survive in the unstable world of whirling dreams. They even allowed us to preserve fragments of our old knowledge and memories, however elusive they may be.*

*Ironically, what has marked us so painfully has become our special gift.*


# 1013
*It reminds me of my first office, my student days, the very beginnings. Sensory deprivation tank in the basement, solitude in the attic, and the crazy beginnings of research - chaotic but relentless.*

*I remember the first real transition - at first, I didn't even know I was dreaming - everything was so real and familiar, yet different. The view outside the window changed, yet I recognized specific places. The streetcar ran as usual - but it was not on the tracks, it was hovering high above the ground. I saw the city centre, but the buildings were many times larger and seemed to change constantly. The air was filled with grotesque vehicles. The colourful glow of light separated the streets and neighborhoods, and a dense fog ran down the cobblestones of the streets.*

*Then I realized that I was not alone in the room. Alice, my younger sister, was sitting in the armchair and reading a book... How could I forget about her? Maybe because we never had the chance to meet there, on the other side.*

- Gain **card II-41 W (Ghost from the past)**.


# 1014
*Someone had a sick sense of humor building this coffin-shaped ship. Who would like to sail a coffin? What sea could encourage the use of such a vessel? It's just a dream sea. Farther beyond its borders lies black empty waters and some barely visible unknown lands. It is better not to go there because we do not know what awaits us.*

*Although... Funny, land is just land, known or unknown - what's the difference? Have none of us really been there? Then why do I feel as if I know exactly what's over there?*

*Oh, what's this? A nice trinket, just wipe the mud off it first!*

- Gain **1** `ether`.


# 1015
*We look far into the sparkling sea horizon. What lies beyond this impenetrable border is not known but something tells us that we must have come from there. Maybe it is because that's where we come from - we are strangers, invaders - and this world wants to annihilate us at all costs.*

- You may Relocate the Team to any Location on the Dreamworld Map or **Restore 3 Items**.

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.


# 1016
*The child smiles when, at last, we agree to play with it. It was rough-housing all the time in order to get our attention? But it's not just about having fun. We stop to really live in the moment - to see again for the first time since forever.*

*It's hard to go on without hiding behind the right mask. But when we can take it off for a moment, we can really breathe.*

<u>*Victory.*</u> This Slumber ends.

- Remove this Slumber tile from the game.

*We found a new friend.*

- Add **tile II-38 J (Mischievous Child)** to the Slumbers deck.


# 1017
*"It won't happen, I'm safe," we assured ourselves while crossing a bridge over a river - the boards were in excellent condition. And yet we couldn't stop imagining falling into the frigid waters. We didn't listen to that irrational whisper and as if our fears had powers of their own, the wood broke under our weight.*

*Why do we remember this now? And why does the gaze of the candle seem so piercing?*

- Gain **1** `gem`. Continue the Slumber. 


# 1018
*That empty house again - wallpaper peeling off cracked walls, squeaky chairs and dirty furniture. Again, I missed the time.*

*None of us managed to be here on time.*

- Gain **1** `ether`.


# 1019
*How to turn back time? Sometimes we want to go back many years, sometimes only a few seconds. A few seconds before the mystery of the broken glass began, before the world began to spin in a dance, when the earth changed places with the sky, and the sky fell straight under the wheels.*

*Two entangled souls sped rapidly into the future and then one suddenly stopped. The quiet rhythmic beats so close to my heart that then receded forever, becoming slower and slower, until finally there was only an endless pause.*

*The pain wasn't the worst. The worst part was the end of reality, behind which the gates of hell slowly opened. And the fear that there would be some 'tomorrow' after today. Red snakes swirled in the broken glass, the wheel spun like a flying circus, slower and slower. Only the ruby-red gasoline was dripping slowly.*

- Gain **1 Hour**.

- Gain **1** `ether`.


# 1020
*We grab our enemy and begin to choke his throat without mercy. He tried to get in our way - enough of this!*

*All restrictions on our freedom are equally bad. We will not allow them. Others do not count - if they make us lose even a fraction of our liberty, they will regret it. Our freedom is sacred, and there is no price for it!*

*And yet the guard who is lying helpless continues to laugh...*

- This Slumber ends (without Victory or Failure).


# 1021
*This factory seems so familiar... I go to work almost automatically - it won't get done with me sitting in bed. There is no need to rest, as rest is for wimps. A real tough guy is not afraid of hard work. This is what he lives for - only cowards and weaklings run away from real, hard work. A decent stand-up person is never ashamed of it. Well, you'll get a little dirty, sure - but you can be proud.*

*And then I need to rest a bit, have fun, give myself a moment. I have to somehow relax before the next day. After all, it's my money, I earned it myself, and no one will tell me what to do with it.*

- Gain **card II-41 V (Fever)**.


# 1023
*Why can't it understand that we have to get there? Our rage builds up, and we start daring the conductor. It also loses control over itself, and, in a fierce tussle, we push it off the train. We hear fading curses and a promise of punishment.*

This Slumber ends (without Victory or Failure).

***Things will get worse from now on.***

Remove **tile X1 (Conductor)** from the game. From now on, you'll be using **tile X2** in the Train Dream. 


# 1024
*The city I used to live in was changing every year, new generations appeared, cars took on more and more new shapes, some buildings fell apart to make room for others. Few of the places lasted - like the old corner shop. It was there when I was a child, it was still there when I was old. I liked to look there - you never knew what you would find on one of the shelves full of different junk each time. It was like an unarranged museum - you could search it from morning to night, all your life, and every day you would find new wonders worth living for.*

- Gain **1** `ether`.


# 1025
*The machine is scary. It's cruel and ruthless. But it must have a purpose, as all things that were made. It follows us everywhere, sometimes marking its presence in a very painful way.*

*When we stop fighting it, the machine approaches and we can look at it closely. Then we discover that we were the ones who built it. We regain control over it and find out it's actually a really useful contraption.*

<u>*Victory.*</u> This Slumber ends.

- Remove this Slumber tile from the game.

***We found a real treasure.***

Add **card II-41 E (The Machine)** to the Fate deck.


# 1026
*Many have probably wondered what is hidden inside this beast. I know there's nothing there. It is simply a soulless and powerful nothing with no feelings. It doesn't care about people, it just moves forward like a steamroller. Uncaringly, it will crush everything, you cannot argue with it, you cannot outsmart or bribe it. It is a blind and ruthless fate. Pray that it will not turn its gaze upon you.*

*The shadows deepen with each strike.*

*"Stop, just stop," the shadow weeps. But we can't - we have to strike it one more time as our fists don't bleed enough yet. We want to be truly hurt!*

*"I'm sorry... I was just like everyone else, I was only thinking about myself. Now I see a little more clearly but it's too late. Forgive me."*

*The man was begging us for help. He wanted us to call his little girl but we thought he was another drunkard lying on a pavement. He would probably never find her, but let's give him some company during his hopeless search.*

*The wraith looks at us curiously but doesn't say a word.*

*"We'll look for her together," we say.*

*A sad look and a slight nod of agreement.*

*We run up the stairs as fast as possible... And then, it looks like we can go even faster. We start to slide along the steps, and after a while, we are basically hovering over them, only holding onto the railing. Wow, this is awesome!*

- Gain **card C (Stairs)**. Each other Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.


# 1037
*We stand over a shapeless mass of flesh. Our clothes are soaked in blood, our skin stinks horribly. But we feel a little purer and lighter. We got rid of something that weighed heavily on our hearts and tempted us to do vile things. What we abhor in others is sometimes the most difficult to eradicate in ourselves. You won't do it all at once, but it's always a step forward.*

# 1042
*I love masks - they are colourful and funny, full of life. And they offer a sense of safety. They are not fake at all - quite the opposite. It's the mask that reveals to me who I am. After all, we always have to invent ourselves so as not to be ordinary shapeless nothings. We are born with a mask, and then choose to modify it or look for a new one. Take it off, and you'll see that there's nothing underneath!*

*The guard is more than he seems. He always accompanies us, whether we like it or not, preventing us from achieving our goals. We do not live alone in the world, not every dream can be fulfilled at once. And that is his job - to make us question ourselves before we make plans, to safeguard us from doing something stupid.* 

*That's the world and it's sometimes better not to change it. Accept the obstacles, move around them. But know you won't be able to change the rules. At least not while he's around.*

*The mask is always the same, cold and emotionless, but the faces beneath it are constantly changing. Here is the subservient executor of hideous commands, never refusing, eternally loyal. Here is a priest who has long since lost his faith. Here is the forger who signed the stolen work. Here is a drunkard father whose child was kidnapped. Here is the mother who sacrificed another's child to save hers. Here is a man who belittles and tortures others for his own pleasure. Faces change but the mask is perfect, hiding all.*

*How long has it been since our group left the fading microcosm of our laboratory and embarked on the crazy journey into the Dreamlands? There were six of us, but one of us was lost at the very beginning - what's worse, now we can't even remember who it was. Even if we met them here we probably wouldn't recognise them again.*

*Sometimes we split up, only to meet again later, but how many of us will make it to the end?*

*This might not be our first trip - we may have already undertaken it many times, but without success. This might just be another desperate attempt - the memories soon to be lost to the tides of time.*

# 1048
*A long time ago, our dreams were purer and innocent. We enjoyed childish pranks and little lies but never with ill-intent, always just to have a little fun. Now we deceive to get ahead, to survive and compete - nobody laughs about it anymore.*

*Synthetic archives GAP3077/04: The Final Frontier.*

*How to alter reality? How could we build a better world without suffering and full of happiness? In dreams, we don't have a problem with that - but here in this "real" stable world we share with others there are so many barriers to achieving this.*

*The Final Frontier - a great challenge, a scientific project that eventually destroyed the world. The results of the study were bleak at first. We were searching for the difference between the world of dreams and what we called reality, and slowly understood that there was no difference. A study by our scientists suggested that the Dream world was less real. What was more surprising was that when the exact research methodology was replicated by scientists on the other side the conclusion was exactly the opposite - that our waking world was "less real".*

*It looked like we were our own mirror images. The only differences being that our world was more stable and the Dream world possessed greater powers of creation. We were able to move between these two worlds without any problem. However this was not enough for us. We desired to control completely this power of creation. Because it was shared with billions of other dreamers everything here was the average of all that we believed in, what we wanted and what we were afraid of.*

*And then, the ESC developed the first prototype of the Key. The principle was that if you could isolate your part of the dreamworld, you could change it to a limited extent and forcibly bring your dreams into reality. We strengthened our frequencies surpressing those belonging to others and after suffering a miserable beginning, the door was finally opened. The rest was merely a technology race.*

*Coupled Keys, reinforced Keys, accelerated Keys, i-Keys. Technology quickly became obsession. Everyone wanted to maximise their own individual control over creation and Dreams. This technology was not cheap so ordinary people could not afford even the cheapest and weakest of Keys, becoming slaves of worlds created by others.*

*Reality was greeted with new wonders - bigger with every passing day, grander and more amazing than ever before. It became full of realised dreams. Unfortunately it also resembled the dreamworld more and more. Individual new worlds became so separate that, in the end, nothing distinguished them from ordinary dreams. There was no longer one shared reality - it had fractured into nothing more than countless, infinite microcosms.*

*So my belief when it comes to the Great Disaster was that no one really attacked us. It wasn't a meteorite, or sun flares, nor from any divine judgement. This force was too powerful and we weren't ready to control it. It was no one but outselves, in all of our folly and hubris, who destroyed our own world.*

*My faithful little helpers. I don't know what I would have done without you in these difficult times. Only you understand me. We understand each other so well...

When I am fed up with everything, you help me forget my worries and enter restful dreams.*

*But why do you sometimes hurt my family when I'm asleep? It might not be you at all. But...*

*The candle is gone and so is our rage. It's so dark and cold in here now. We feel uncertain. What hides in the shadows? Will we fall down when we take a step forward? Why do we feel so lost?!*

*The light hidden deep within us has gone out. We took it for granted and rarely appreciated it, as it was elusive and inconstant and yet without it we have lost our direction. We move as if in a fog.*

*Sometimes a seemingly insignificant detail unlocks something we didn't even realise. Like this one here...*

*It was so long ago at the Clinic. That year our research had moved much further ahead, entering forbidden and dangerous areas beyond the boundaries of ethics and science. Having studied dreams for many years, we were still barely scratching the surface of the real mystery - the ultimate dream, the eternal sleep - otherwise known as death. We had already collected countless descriptions of its vestibule - tunnels and light, scenes from our lives flashing before our eyes, the shadows of loved ones and guides encountered - but it was difficult to conclude whether this was anything more than a biochemical reaction of the brain to the critical state when its functions faded away.*

*Something really important happened that day. The test object completely passed the door of Death, passed over to the other side... and returned. They came back to tell us about what they saw there. I'd had a sense of what this secret was for some time but could not confirm my suspicions ... until now.*

*"My mom bought me it." - The kid smiles sadly, but calmly.*

- Gain **1** `ether`.


# 1056
*This war is our apocalypse... when we look at the dark shadows on the empty bench, we understand what it means - the end of everything that has ever existed. Everything, at least for us. When your life ends, and you are gone - this is your own apocalypse.*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`.

- Gain **3 Hours**.


# 1057
*We become nothing but living rage. We don't want to remember it anymore - webs of memories, painful stings that keep coming back like spider bites. Where are our foes? We want to squash something but the spiders are gone.*

*Yellow eyes glisten in the tunnel, rarely blinking. Is it an oncoming train?*

*The rails come out of the tunnel and disappear into the fog. Here, everything is surrounded by dense mists that delimit places and permeate everything. They devour the surroundings in front of our eyes as if wanting to erase everything from existence. The oppressiveness of the mists sometimes feels as though they are there to punish us.*

*We feel the weight of the suitcases. Oh what the hell, on an impulse, we throw them toward the yellow eyes. The lights disappear in the dark.*

*A glimpse of salvation makes the shadow open its heart before us ... it's so naive! We feel almost sorry for it when we steal its hopes once again.*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`. Continue the Slumber.


# 1062
*It's difficult but we're beginning to see the boundaries of colliding dreams - our own and those we visit. They are often shrouded in fog but as soon as we notice any anomaly, the borders begin to immediately morph and disappear, as if they were 'repairing' the perceived fault. It's also difficult to remember these anomalies as the memory also begins to blur, inconsistencies correcting themselves.*

*But now that we know about them, we can try to explore them further - it's hard, but we already know where to look.*


# 1063
*When we think of them, we feel dread. Our body breaks out in a cold sweat, our hands are numb and clammy, we can't think clearly. Fear has a crippling power and we need to overcome it.*

*But are these fears real? Do these creatures exist outside or are they manifestations directly from within us? Understanding is the basis. And we already know that today is a good day to fight fire with fire.*

- Gain **1** `gem`. Continue the Slumber. 


# 1064
*This lab reminds me of something.*

*It was a long time ago. In one year of our research, the laboratory was already able to test over ten thousand sleeping volunteers, gather accurate data from the course of each cycle, transcribe countless memories, and conduct even more experiments. Dreams were more than just dreams - their realities became not so different from our world.*

*More and more, we began to notice a completely separate category of dreams, or rather 'gates' to another world. Volunteers awoke there and led their second lives as their usual ones and alarmingly began treating their real lives, here in the waking world, as just dreams.*

*After 'awakening' in that other world, their second memory immediately returned. Many felt at home there - even though they had completely different families, jobs, appearances and names. That world was similar to ours but even so it seemed that the development of their civilization moved in a slightly different direction than ours.*

*Some people didn't even want to return from there. So far we've been able to bring everyone back. However the sleeping figure in front of us was not responding to the awakening program. We couldn't get her to wake up. Her brain worked intensely while dreaming but her body lay limp, clutching a toy - a small puppet dressed in a yellow coat.*

- Gain **1** `ether`.


# 1065
*Every day we wear masks, so putting on another is as easy as breathing. A blank slate covers our face, making us look like these creeps. They lose their interest in us and go away. We want to smile, but can't. Our neck is tired of lifting so many visages.*

*Nothing lasts forever. Happiness may end one day, of course, but the worst pain will also eventually pass - one way or another.*

*Sometimes, the sun finally rises and drives out the darkness, and sometimes, we see a faint glow of new hope. Sometimes, the system just burns out, the void swallowing everything and the soul rises freely for the first time in a long time. It's just a matter of waiting it out, even when everything seems impossible, when we're trapped in a frozen moment.*

***Synthetic archives GAP3077/05: Lost in a lost world.***

*We've lost control - reality has fallen apart. We've turned it into countless, separate dreams - there is nothing else beyond them. No one can predict how long such a state could last - hundreds or thousands of years, because time has been diminished to just another, insignificant dimension.*

*And yet within each shard of reality exist smaller groups of consciousness, inhabitants who try to recreate what was once our lost world with incomplete memories. Fragment by fragment, details being rebuilt limited by their own powers of creation. And on top of this they must defend themselves against interlopers who could destroy their noble efforts, absorbing them into their own dreams.*

*Now groups of scientists trapped in the bubbles of artificial worlds are trying to find a way to restore the common world through the search for an essential missing element. If we find it, we'll finally be able to restore our forgotten real world step by step, expanding its borders and nullifying the chaotic powers that exist outside. And maybe, just maybe, one day we'll really be home again.*

*Where to start our search? Let's start with the most powerful, distinct dream worlds that can trap and transform newcomers. They contain a secret of the lost stability.*

*It's a risky mission because, by joining someone's dream you inevitably become part of it. You can easily lose your existing memories, knowledge and turn into just another puppet subject to the will of the ruler of such a world. However, we have our own methods and technology that can help us. And we have nothing to lose...*


# 1070
*The dogs whimper and run away without any hesitation - it seems they are used to it. Was our outburst right? Should we flail our fists at them? They wouldn't understand anything else - they're just dogs, right? We're not going to listen to their constant pointless barking.*

*"Don't try this with me," the shapeless whispers. "Or do you want to see what real deception looks like?"*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `gem`. Continue the Slumber.


# 1075
*It's time to take a look at this strange artifact made of some black crystal. The eye on it attracts my attention the most. When I examine it, the pupil enlarges and seems to pull me into its gaze. For a moment, I become a reflection inside the crystal itself. Inside the crystal room I open a doorway in front of me and see hundreds of mirrored walls - multiplying endlessly to an infinite sequence of doors, each leading to a different, separate world.*

*At this moment, I remember the closest of those worlds and the memories of some of the lives I had lived or that I would eventually live come flooding into my mind. It is endless. Overwhelming. I jump back to my body and find myself holding the strange artifact in my hand.*

- **Block 1 Step** on the **current Turn card.**

- Discard **1 Morphing** or discard **all** `threat` from the Dreamscape.

# 1078
*If a person can turn into a rat over the course of their life, then maybe with time, they can also change back again. I succeeded in doing this, even though it wasn't easy. I managed to break out of this gray world. It's been a long time since I've been in the Pipe District, but I still remember every corner here. Nothing has changed here.*

*A huge figure, a hulk made of muscles and anger, crawls from under the stone. It drags a large scythe behind it. The sturdy armor flakes off and the figure noticeably grows younger. Scars seem to disappear and its muscles grow smaller, leaner. Then his mask slips off and surprisingly reveals the joyful face of a young man. His gaze seems far off though, seeking an elusive woman's voice. Part of us hopes he'll succeed.*

*Time runs forward - or maybe backward? - and the youngster turns into a child, then turns into a messy chunk of flesh, only to disappear into a blank slate full of possibilities.* 

*We're sure we'll meet him again.*

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.

- Keep the **"Newcomer"** token, but place a `block` token on it - you can't use it again in this Dream.


# 1080
*We stare at the puppets with cold unmoving eyes - we become both an embodiment of threat and steely calmness. They become still, obviously paralysed with fear. They start retreating slowly and, finally, they're gone. We realised we were so lost in staring at them that we didn't notice the passage of time.*

- Lose `player` **Hours**.

*It wasn't always the same. Sometimes the evenings were quiet - we were a normal family back then. I loved those moments. I liked to sit on the windowsill and watch the stars, and my father pointed at the constellations and talked about what he knew, that he maybe had read or heard somewhere - those quiet evenings were like holidays. I would give everything for one such moment again.*

*Back then, he seemed to be a real sage. Every child believes that their parents can do everything, that their father is the strongest, and that their mother is the smartest and most beautiful, that they are the richest of all people around, and that their car is the best of all, that everything will always be fine with them. Kids tend to believe in them without question.*

*The conductor must be one of the most powerful guardians of the Dreamworld. He watches over the train, forcing others to follow the rules and increasing the fare the farther you want to go. Acquiring valuable things requires extra effort - there is always a price and no easy way to get them. But were we happy with that?*

*I knew that I should have returned there then but I just couldn't. I was just so scared. I wanted to forget about it, erase the nightmare from my head.*

*But since then I've felt a shadow behind my back, whispers in my ear. And they never stop! Even when I try to sleep they haunt me... Give me a break! It's not my fault! Do you hear me?!*

*Oh wait a minute! What a beautiful sight! When I look away I feel better right away.*

- Gain **1** `ether`.

*The puppets' movement draws our attention. We want to play with them regardless of their terrifying appearance. Whenever they are around, we are completely enraptured with their dances - losing track of time, distracted from whatever plans we had.*

*"Leave it, break it, and come to us! Come on!"*

*They are like old toys we love too much to throw away until eventually there are too many. Their influence makes us forget what we are and what is important. We have to be careful not to get caught up in their endless dances.*

- Gain **1** `gem`. Continue the Slumber.


# 1094
*This is a precious gift - a clever trick that I learned to finally free myself from the nightmare. All it takes is a few shining gems and you're floating in a total void where nothing can harm you. Nothing is real here - there are no longer any consequences. I can shape this world as I like - I can start anew and create my own. Here I am completely free.*

- Gain **1** `ether`. 


# 1096
*When we look at them, we feel a sense of aversion. Their eyes accuse us of things we didn't do. And even if we did unknowingly manage to wrong them, they have no right to stare at us so incriminatingly! We have to somehow drown them out, at least for a while... What do you want from us?! Leave us alone!*

*"I don't need help!" the wraith shouts, pushing us with a cold hand. "Especially not yours!"*

- Gain **1** `gem`. Continue the Slumber.

# 1104
*I remember her - my beloved soulmate. How could she go? How could I lose her? Everything was great for a long time - these were the best moments of my life.*

*But then this feathered spectre appeared. I saw him sometimes in the corner of my eye, in mirrors and reflections on glass. I was sure he was long dead but he came back, his hunger ravenous. His presence crept closer and closer and I lived every day as if I was counting down the time to my final demise. It was hard for me to take it - this permanent fixture in our house.*

*And then one day I stopped noticing him. But the worst part was that he was still there - now invisible, he could do whatever he desired. One too many whispers and I finally lost her forever.*

- Remove the **"Oblivion" Flaw card** after resolving it, if you have it in your hand.

- Gain **1** `ether`.

# 1105
*When we're trapped in wheelchairs, all stairs are impassable mountains. Unless we use a lift.*

*We won't break down the walls that surround us but we can get to know them and look for doors in them. And sometimes we can just walk through them.*

***Synthetic archives GAP3077/03: Endless Sleep Clinic.***

*When there is a demand for something, the answer appears. In the second half of life, many of us finally realize that there is less time than we would like to have when we begin to see the finish line in sight. Time erodes away our former skills and abilities, our former appearance and we all become a shadow of what we were. The reality hits us that it will never be better again. But can we buy some extra time? Can we find our former selves again?*

*Of course, we can - the solution is so very obvious! Thanks to Endless Sleep Clinic (ESC) we can achieve what is impossible. Never again will we have to feel the inevitable decay of our mortal shells.*

*When Professor Shelley started the ESC, he was in a wheelchair, and his eyesight was modest but he definitely knew what he was looking for. He also knew that seconds of genuine brightness, moments of happiness, and revelations of truth appear very rarely in ordinary life being difficult to see in the rat race of the waking world. In dreams however, we experience them all the time.*

*He noticed that memories of real events and dreams were perceived in the same way by the human mind. Time however moves much slower in dreams, and in a few seconds, you can experience long hours, and in hours - whole weeks. Sleeping is one-third of our human lives, simply wasted because we cannot use these hours properly. In dreams, time and opportunity can be found - we can be ourselves again - or even more - there.*

*Such were the early beginnings of the ESC - research, expanding lucid dreaming skills, practicing dream remembering, discovering secrets of strange worlds. And the respondents had more interesting lives there than in their last decades. They visited new worlds, built unforgettable memories, developed new skills, without past pain, without restrictions. Time did not seem to matter. They had never lived like this before.*

*And yet there was one more limit to cross, the final frontier: how could we share our dreams with others?*

# 1107
*First impressions could be misconstrued. We took these people for other horrors, but it seems that they are simply inhabitants of the same world as we. Yes, they are different, but is it wrong? It's good that there are others in this world and through them, perhaps we can view things differently - maybe understand ourselves better and change.*

*We clear up the misunderstanding and finally find common ground.*

<u>Victory.</u> This Slumber ends.

- Remove this Slumber tile from the game.

*Understanding leads us to a better future.*

- Add **tile II-38 E (Friendly Strangers)** to the Slumbers deck.

# 1108
*Neither a box nor an animal... Like almost everything in this world, this mysterious item is a cluster of several different memories. I can see it clearly now - a dreaming brain amalgamating random elements together, weaving divergent threads and objects into strange new combinations. All this is nothing more than categorisation of memories and knowledge - an innate ability of our minds presenting to us a conceivable reality no matter how ridiculous the material it's given.*

*We close the box again, stroking it gently on the head.*

- Gain **2 Hours**.

- Each Dreamer gains **1** `ether`.

# 1110
*The way it extends its hand with the candle, the sound of its wheezing breath... Could it be...?*

*The repressed memory returns clearly. We could have helped him, but we moved along as any sane person would do. Are we all heartless creatures? He wasn't even drunk, and his heart squirmed in pain. In a sudden outburst of compassion, we approach the wraith, wincing before its cold aura.*

**Choose 1:**

- [**Get straight to the point**] -> (1103).

- [**Apologize**] -> (1028).

# 1111
*There's something hidden in the dark - invisible and non-corporeal. Others don't see them, but I sense them there. I can feel their silhouettes and strange faces lurking in the shadows. Why have they come to us from so far away? What mission do they have to fulfil? Or maybe they're just observers, gathering information and hoping to one day exchange knowledge with us?*

*I think that in one of my lifetimes, I may have lived on their planet. I feel like I understand them a little. These creatures are sad. They examine our world but cannot communicate with us. I know that they try to talk to us but our ears can't hear them. They're so near and yet also so far away, in their cold, alien world.*

*They've come a long way to get here, longer than we can imagine...*

=>Gain 1 `ether`.

# 1112
*Strangers stand before us, a little scared, but reluctant to give us an advantage. We feel similar - we're afraid of them but we can't let them gain the upper hand.*

*Why are they not like us? They think differently, talk differently, like different things, and believe in something different altogether. They shouldn't exist!*

=>Gain 1 `gem`. Continue the Slumber.

# 1113
*The photos are constantly changing. They blur before my eyes as if they were enveloped in a hazy fog, from which after a while, another memory or a fleeting, unrealised dream emerges.*

*I pick up another photo - I remember this one clearly. Happy days, two suns entwined in inescapable gravity, big plans, singing and dancing.*

*"Let's go!"*

*"But now? Maybe tomorrow?"*

*"Right now! Now or never! I feel that there may be no tomorrow."*

*The sound of the engine drowns out the laughter.*

=>Gain 1 `ether`.

# 1114
*We shatter the creep's mask to find another lifeless face-guard under it. We break it, and the next, and the next...*
*In the end, the creeps lie in the pile of smashed porcelain, their limbs twitching, their masks glistening mockingly. We couldn't defeat them. And
we know that they will come back.*

This Slumber ends (without Victory or Failure).

=>Remove this Slumber tile from the game.

=>Gain **card II-34 B (An ominous trophy)**.

*We made things worse.*

=>Add **tile II-38 D (Fearsome Faceless Creeps)** to the **Slumbers deck**.

# 1116
*We stop running and stand resolute before the crawling horror. It quivers under our harsh look, screeching, and weeping.*

*"You don't know," it stutters. "You don't know what you're doing. You won't survive without me! You need me more than anything..."*

*Eventually it goes away discouraged, and fades into darkness. But we are sure it did not go away for long. It will come back, that's for sure.*

<u>Victory.</u> This Slumber ends.

# 1118
*We have a feeling that we can trust it. Though our sense of intuition sometimes refuses to work (and is occasionally wrong), we know that it can cast some light on more obscure matters. It is like an ancient part of reason, invisible to us today, but still working and trying to help us.*

*It is like a candle in the dark. But we've all forgotten it a long time ago.*

=>Gain 1 `gem`. Continue the Slumber.

# 1120
*We scream at the horror, wanting it to shut its doors and become an unmoving piece of furniture. We shout at ourselves for being ignorant fools who don't know anything about this wicked world.*

=>Discard 1 **Active Item** to the Storage and gain 1 `gem`. Continue the Slumber.

# 1121
*The Dream Factory - a land for those who are not afraid to dream about something more, who are not satisfied with everyday life, who do not recognize limitations. I don't want to simply walk on earth, I want to float above it like a perfect angel.*

*For me, dancing is more than just for entertainment or sport. This is the path I want to follow to perfection, to break free from the poor shell of the human body and become something better. I'm good at it but the best is yet to come.*

*Nothing can get in my way - obstacles are for losers and cowards. No adversity can stop me. And since we are together - our power is equal only to our happiness.*

*It was so - but a merciless doom was just around the corner, and our time was counting down toward the end, although we didn't know it at this moment.*

=>Gain 1 `ether`.

# 1122
*We look at the degenerates, trying to see beyond our contempt. When we manage to overcome our prejudice, we discover that we're looking at our own weaknesses. Who do we despise then?*

*We will never get rid of them, all we can do is keep them under control. Control however much we can and never let them get too close to us.*

=>Gain 1 `gem`. Continue the Slumber.

# 1123
*A familiar face hides in a feathery black cloud - I almost forgot this visage, yet I cannot remember...*

*I recognize bloody claws and this curved beak. I hate that face, but I see it often when I look in the mirror.*

=>Gain 1 `ether`.

# 1125
*For many years, in the darkest of moments - when I was losing my faith and life seemed to be crumbling to dust around me - I could always go back there. To the warm sunny days and beautiful golden hills. In time, I didn't know if they were really just childhood memories or a strange, hidden made-up land, always looming somewhere over the horizon - sometimes visible - but which no one would ever be able to reach.*

=>Gain 1 `ether`.

# 1126
*Even overcome with rage, we cannot force ourselves to hit a child. So we start destroying everything around it. Just like that time when we smashed a window when we realized how much we had changed. We could no longer look directly in a mirror afterwards without shame.*

*All this anger not only affects the people around us but also ourselves.*

=>Suffer 2 `damage`. Continue the Slumber.

# 1127
*I know this ball well... and I do not want to think about it.*

*But this red ball reminds me of something else, something much older, a memory even more blurred and deep:* ***two suns in the sky.***

*And us - energies dancing in the dense atmosphere of the gray planet, to the rhythm emanating from beloved stars. I could stay there forever.*

*But there I would know nothing but everlasting happiness.*

=>Gain 1 `ether`.

# 1128
*Leave me alone or I'll do something to myself, you'll see. You'll regret it. Walk away, I'm warning you...*

=>Gain 1 `gem`. Continue the Slumber.

# 1129
*Not that... Among the debris drifting in the cosmic void, a ruined clock is floating - it reads **4:05pm**. That damn hour that lasted for so many years. Eventually, it moved on - so why is it floating here? If we can't wake up from this nightmare, then maybe we're not sleeping at all...*

=>Gain 1 `ether`.

# 1130
*We stop struggling, we stop the pointless fight. Spiders crawl all over us, their hairy legs tickling our exposed skin. They start weaving a cocoon that quickly envelops us. In its warm and silent interior, we start to remember everything that happened to us. We learn from our bad experiences, we find joy in the good ones... and we release them all - no longer do we latch onto them.*

*When we emerge from the cozy pod, we feel lighter. The spiders are gone, as they've achieved their goal.*

<u>Victory.</u> This Slumber ends.

- Add **card II-34 H (Poisoned Thorn)** to the **Influence Market**.

- Remove this Slumber tile from the game.

*Something changed. For the better.*

Add **tile II-38 I (Friendly Spiders)** to the Slumbers deck.

# 1131
***I'll never forget those sunshine days...***

*The sun was beating mercilessly down upon us, but as a child, I didn't pay attention to such little things - I even loved the heat on my skin. I was looking forward to the moment when the dirt road ended and from behind the hill appeared the gate of the park - the entrance to the mysterious labyrinth of gardens.*

*"Dad, what if there are bad dogs there?"*

*"Don't worry, child. There are no dogs. Barney didn't want to hurt you at all either. He was just a little sick...You know, Barney would never hurt you if he could recognize his best friend."*

=>Gain 1 `ether`.

# 1132
*It's time to change our relationship, cardboard man. We will not fight or avoid you anymore. With courage we gain even more strength to fight our fears. Let our friendship begin and overcome whatever awaits us on this path.*

<u>Victory.</u> This Slumber ends.

=>Remove this Slumber tile from the game.

*We have a new friend.*

=>Gain **card II-34 A (Box Knight).**

# 1133
*"Someone will find out. Someone will recognize me - and that will be the end. But I can never admit to it either - that would be the end too! I'm sure somebody recorded it, and they will send the tape one day — then everyone will know for sure."*

*Those intrusive thoughts again! I didn't do anything wrong, it wasn't my fault! I was just too scared, I couldn't go back there. Most people in my position would have done the same. It's already difficult for me to live with it - I don't need any additional punishment...*

*What do I need these thoughts for? Huh, I'll try and think of something happier! Do you know this joke? Three pigs come to the store...*

=>Gain 1 `ether`.

# 1134
*Threatening an already broken spirit is child's play. But we don't gain anything but louder weeping and pangs of remorse instead of any useful knowledge.*

=>**Seal 2 cards**. Continue the Slumber.

# 1135
*Fear paralyses us, but we fight it with sheer rage. The longer we remain idle, the more we are afraid, and the more difficult it is to overcome the dread. We have to move on, rip their fragile veils to shreds and spit on their ethereal corpses. Just do it, don't think too much!*

<u>Victory.</u> 

=>This Slumber ends.

# 1136
*Their barking could be some sort of speech. We fear them because we find the guttural cries harsh and aggressive and in a language we don't comprehend. Their teeth aren't as sharp as we thought but the fear of 'otherness' makes them seem so much sharper.*

*We wonder if we understood them, would we be able to tolerate or even cooperate with them? And in doing so, we begin to see that they are not dogs after all.*

*Other people, other viewpoints often seem like unbreakable walls. It's easy to change the unknown into enemies. Into furious dogs. Much too easy sometimes.*

Gain 1 `gem`. Continue the Slumber.

# 1137
**Synthetic archives GAP3077/06: The arrival.**

*It was hard to remember anything - the black abyss devoured all our memories, our mind strays in a dark fog. We didn't remember our names, where we came from, or who we were. We had some equipment with us, but it began to crumble, turn into scraps and useless items. Each of us remembered something different and fragmented like pieces of a photograph that fit together all wrong. A laboratory and scientific devices, great fires in the sky and that disturbing newspaper headline - "Is this the end of the world? How will it end?".*

*Has there ever been anything besides this forest? Have we ever done anything other than to wander these woods? Where were we going? Why were we here? We still pushed forward despite being tired of this journey, constantly walking onwards, running away from everything, in our search for... something. Behind us we felt a dark entity pursuing us but we dared not stop.*

*When we left, there were four of us. The fifth joined later, not really knowing where they came from. We all forgot what happened back then.
Eventually we left the mists behind and found that we were at the edge of a giant valley. There was a swamp at the bottom of it. We slowly descended the steep slopes, clinging to the trees like children hugging their mothers.*

*Something felt immediately wrong. There was something down there. Something that didn't trust us, despised us and didn't want us there. We were intruders after all. The creature followed us, tracking us by scent and the echo of our footsteps. We felt its gaze on our backs. It was there, hiding in the shadows - we were sure of it.*

*The sounds of this forest were unsettling. The trees were monstrous, their branches like claws that obscured the sky. The fog returned. After the next hour of walking something else appeared - a strange, disturbing sound. Something was coming for us...*

*We went further and managed to climb the mountain. There was a road there like a tunnel in a dense forest. The fog was thinning. When we heard the sound of beating hooves, we quickly hid - just in time too, as strange creatures dashed past us along the road. They were mostly humanoid but with horses' heads and hooves. They seemed formidable and aggressive.*

*When the clatter died down, we pushed on. Little did we know it was to greater peril, as we found out later. One by one, we all became sick. One of us disappeared. I was sure we would find each other again eventually, but it was easy to get lost there. Our memories began to disappear once again. As soon as we got off the path, we were already somewhere else. We tried to return, but there was no turning back - the path behind us was gone.*

*There was something wrong with this world. And the predator was still getting closer...*

# 1138
*Steel springs sting our fingers and the acrid smell of rust and oil fills our nostrils. The machine is no more, but we have a hunch that this was only one of its countless bodies. We quickly gather some parts to analyse later and retreat before something worse appears.*

This Slumber ends (without Victory or Failure).

=>Remove this Slumber tile from the game.

=>Gain **card II-34 F (Analysis Apparatus).**

*We have a feeling that something changed. For the worse.*

=>Add **tile II-38 F (The Fearsome Machine)** to the Slumbers deck.

# 1139
*This feeling reminds me of a dark place that I ventured into during one of my trips to the inner worlds. There, I came across a strange figure, seemingly asleep. As I approached, I immediately knew that I was not dealing with a normal human, but instead what remained of a strange and powerful entity.*

*I felt the accumulated life force left behind by someone who had ceased to exist physically in our world and was instead lost between here and whatever lies beyond.*

*She had retained her intelligence, self-awareness, and even possessed a strange sense of humor. But more importantly, she was able to influence the environment around her, much like the best of our test subjects after they had undergone reinforcement and training. A poltergeist...*

*When I was thinking about joining the team, I realised that on the other side my skills might be less useful, and that we would need some help from someone like that.*

=>Remove the **"Wave of Sorrow" Flaw card** after resolving it, if you have it in your hand.

=>Gain 1 `ether`.

# 1140
*We have met various creatures in these strange dreamlands - most are novel curiosities, benign but a rare few are much more powerful. These are the ones that can create huge stable worlds, expanding their influence so much so that their worlds are completely immune to the influence of newcomers. This power of creation is a trace of what we are looking for.*

*Is this one of the fundamental concepts of this world? An artificial stability where a single overlord constructs the laws and prohibitions and its powerless inhabitants follow them to the letter. But what if a more dominant being enters the world with the power to violate these laws? The current reality would collapse, its stability demolished, shattering it into countless other satellite dreams and starting the cycle anew. Over and over, realities devouring realities until one remains...*

*If so, then the key question is who should become the sole sovereign of this lost final world.*

# 1141
*"Hey, I'm not like them. You don't have to hurt me, I'm just loitering around here! I mean, come on, look at me... harmless as a fly... see..." The creature looks at us, arms outstretched, hoping that we can see that difference.*

*Unfortunately we cannot tell the difference - scavangers all look the same: dirty, repulsive, dangerous. But we know what they're looking for - maybe we even have something that will distract them for a moment.*

=>You may discard 1 active Item to discard all Scavengers.

=>Distribute all available `gem` between Dreamers.

# 1142
*The wraith is clearly seeking something ... or someone. "We can sell you information on your search," we say. The apparition pays us with its crystalized hopes but unfortunately despite trying to barter with it we have nothing valuable to give in return.*

=>Each Dreamer gains 1 `gem`. Continue the Slumber.

# 1144
*"Sorry, hello there! Can you help me? I'm a little bit lost," a timid voice comes from the dimly lit tunnel. We notice a small silhouette veiled in darkness waddling towards us - it stops, opens its suitcase and rummages haphazardly into it. Something flashes in the darkness.* 

*"Excuse me, is this Prague already? Can you help me? Hello? Anybody?
Boy, it's so hot in here!"*

*When the figure emerges from the darkness, it's hard to hide our surprise.*

=>Gain the mini deck of **cards II-34 J (Penguin)**.

# 1145
*"Stay where you are! Don't move or things will get ugly!" we say with the most booming voice we can muster.*

*The faceless creeps recoil but we have a feeling that it's actually not from fear.*

=>Gain 1 `gem`. Continue the Slumber.

# 1147
*"If we wanted to, wiping you off the face of the earth would be like umm... swatting a fly...yes! For now, we have decided to exercise our divine mercy and spare your life. Shoo! Go away little fly, you wouldn't want to awaken our inner beast mode, would you now?"* 

*We don't actually believe these words ourselves and actually think the cardboard man is full of hot air.*

=>Gain 1 `gem`. Continue the Slumber.

# 1148
*There's an underwater tunnel here...*

=>Place this Sign token in any space on the Dreamscape.

From now on, any Dreamer that is in the same space as this Sign token may Relocate to any space in
the Dreamscape. 

If they do, roll the Luck die:

=>`luck-x` = remove this Sign token from the game.

If the Sign token is still in Dreamscape at the end
of the Dream, put it back in Storage - you may use
it again in this Dream.

# 1149
*We're sure the child doesn't mean us ill-will. When it steals something from us, it always stops and glances rascally back at us to see if we're following. And if it inflicts us pain, it does so to draw our undivided attention.*

*In a strange, unexplainable way, we enjoy entertaining this kid. Almost as if we were discovering our own long-lost child-like innocence and naivete locked away deep inside us.*

*I think I begin to understand who you are...*

=>Gain 1 `gem`. Continue the Slumber.

# 1151
*It is interesting that in this world there are almost no rooms without another exit, passage, or door. It is an endless maze of passages, tunnels, stairs, entryways, and windows. As soon as it seems that you are at a dead-end, look around the corner or into an innocuous cupboard - there you will surely find another pathway.*

=>Gain **card II-34 S** (Hideout under a hatch).

# 1152
*We tear the dolls apart - wooden splinters, jagged steel strings and iron smithereens explode around the room. Their bodiless heads
now lie on the ground, smiling eeriely at us. We kick them away, stubbing our toes in the process, and our rage disappears as quickly as it came.
With the mannequins gone, we have plenty of time to repair our damaged equipment.*

=><u>Victory.</u> This Slumber ends.

# 1154
*Close your eyes, hum a pleasant tune and imagine a place without them. They want us scared but don't give them the satisfaction.*

*We think of a freshly baked loaf of bread. We can almost smell its hot, fragrant crust.*

*When we open our eyes, the fearspecters are gone. At least for now.*

=>You may end this Slumber (without Victory or Failure).

=>If not, continue the Slumber.

# 1155
*This amulet was supposed to protect us from evil and misfortune. It didn't work.*

*Or maybe it worked a little - it protected me but not all of us unfortunately.*

=>Cure 2 `damage` or gain 1 `ether`.

# 1156
*‘You won't hurt me anymore? Do you really want to help me?"*

*Once we understood, we were too afraid to go back to them to say sorry. Maybe we have the courage now... To genuinely apologize for the harm we've done in the past for breaking someone's life forever. It's so easy in a game and so hard in the real world.*

*And now we understand - but unfortunately much too late.*

=><u>Victory.</u> This Slumber ends.

=>Remove this Slumber tile from the game.

=>Add **tile II-38 C (The Shadow)** to the Slumbers deck.

# 1157
*A poisonous butterfly soars in the air. All we have to do is to select the next victim...*

=>If the **Permit** Item is active, you may **Poison** 1 Entity in range 3. 

Then, roll the Luck die:

=>`luck-x`/`luck-blank` = Suffer 1 `damage` and discard the **Permit** Item.

Don't remove this Sign token from the game after using it, put it back in the Storage.

# 1158
*We're just like this machine - stumbling between dreams, not knowing what to expect of this world. It's obvious that we don't belong here. If our bodies were made of iron, they would be covered in rust and their internal organs would be crumbling.*

*This machine collects everything.*

*Everything we have known in life is reflected in the patterns on the machine. Every mistake, every sadness and disappointment, every experience has been transformed into one of the cogs and gears inside its metal body. We can fight it, cheat it, keep smashing our head through the walls, following the same paths to nowhere. Or we can acknowledge it, accept it and draw our own conclusions.*

*Even if they are not as we would like them to be.*

=>Gain 1 `gem`. Continue the Slumber.

# 1160
*The train bumps steadily along. Half the passengers are asleep, the other half mulling and murmuring about their unfulfilled lives. We try to make conversation with a stranger who stares at the scrolling bleak landscape out of the train window. He looks like he might as well be staring at an empty wall the way his eyes are eerily not moving.*

*"I've been here for so long that I can't remember... What is this world? It's not real, it's a dream, a waking nightmare. It punishes me again and again for my past sins... What should I do? Will it ever end? Please, will you take this baggage from me?"*

*We look at a heavy suitcase at his feet. It's swollen and slimy.* 

*We can take it away - whatever is inside, it could be good... or not.* 

You may:

=>Resolve **Out of Turns**. Each Dreamer Unseals all cards and gains 1 Flaw.

**OR** 

=>Put this Sign token back in the Storage - you may use it again in this Dream.

# 1161
*The degenerates accept our friendliness and lead us into their world full of sleaziness, sloth, and boredom. When we leave their home later, we discover that it's actually a pretty comfortable way of life.*

*Why try when you can let go? Thanks, brothers!*

=>This Slumber ends (without Victory or Failure).

=>Remove this Slumber tile from the game.

*We've made a mistake - things get worse.*

=>Add **tile II-38 K (Hideous Degenerates)** to the Slumbers deck.

*Why are you always persecuting me?!* 

=>*Leave me alone!*

*Go away or... you'll regret it!*

=>*I'm warning you! You have nothing to look for here.*

*Get out! I'm not afraid anymore!*

=>***I have a gun!***

=>You may add 2 Morphings to gain 1 `ether`.

# 1163
*Six o'clock. The cursed hour when the shadow appears. When I hear footsteps and the door slowly creaks open.*

*A monster appears in it... Not always though. Sometimes there's a gift in there, a big box with a new toy. But more often than not, out comes an angry ghoul blindly searching for little children to gobble up.*

*I remember you, ugly cardboard monster. But I'm not weak anymore!*

=>Discard all Morphings or gain 1 `ether`.

# 1164
*The pain itself is not all that bad. Strength is always born from pain. If it weren't for the grain of sand that scuffed the clam, the pearl would never have formed. The right number of scars creates an impenetrable armor.*

*"This will come in handy in your life. You need this lesson and you will remember it. Now, don't be a wimp and clean it up. And remember brat, strength is always born from pain."*

*These words keep coming back at times like this, words spoken by a shadow somewhere deep in my memory.*

=>Gain 1 `ether`.

# 1166
*"I'm trying to figure out the rules and purpose of the Dream World," I say to the conductor.*

*"I want to travel quickly but don't have time to be for searching for tickets." My words meet the conductor's cold gaze.*

*"You'll have to pay me with a decent conversation," it answers slowly, almost threateningly.*

=>Each Dreamer may gain 1 Flaw - then this Slumber ends with <u>Victory.</u>.

=>If not, continue the Slumber.

# 1167
*I can always rest here - it's a sea of pain all around me and I have nothing to lose. When I am here, nothing can hurt me. Nothing can scare me anymore. Everything is completely irrelevant, small and distant. After what has already happened, all that is and all that ever will be is no longer able to move me.*

*Now, I can float here forever. This is the source of my strength.*

=>Cure 1 `damage` and gain 1 `ether`.

# 1168
*Among the rubbish, there is a picture framed in decorative oakwood: a boy with his grandfather walking along a meadow. It is sunny, sepia-tinged and probably warm.*

*Behind them on the grass, we see some cross-shaped shadows. I guess they are planes of some kind ... Are they bombers?*

*In the second picture, we see lean emanciated figures locked in withered hedge-like cages of barbed wire. One of the characters is trying to claw his way through the thorns. It looks like it will be a gruelling and grisly task. In the real world, it would be just impossible. But perhaps not so much in this one? Hmm...*

*"Why?" we hear an ominous voice in our head. The spectres float menacingly above while we think about this question. Why, indeed? We really don't want to befriend these scary, awful creatures. Their ghastly grating probably means that they don't want it either.*

=>Gain `gem`. Continue the Slumber.

# 1171
*I've never enjoyed travelling. I've always asked myself why people do it? Why take risks unnecessarily? What is out there in the chaotic and unpredictable world that would compel me to leave this sanctuary where I am perfectly happy next to you?*

*I don't like trains either. Strangers and foreign places, everything is so dirty, repulsive and dangerous here. Why can't we live our lives in peace, in our own home, in blissful silence and safety? Why is someone always wanting something from us and forcing us to do anything they want?*

*And unfortunately I was right to think this way. One time I did not listen to this inner voice of wisdom and got behind the wheel. For so many years, I did not leave my home, I rarely walked out the door. I drove so carefully and slowly that night - and they rode so fast. It wasn't my fault - they shouldn't have been going that fast...*

*If I had never left my house, it never wouldn't have happened.*

*Lying on the streets of the city among the cobwebs, I see a car wreck. It seems to have been standing here for an eternity but the spiders have painstakingly cared for it in such a way that it hasn't fallen apart or disappeared into the surrounding detritus.*

*This is their role - to record what it once resembled, to keep those worst memories alive forever.*

=>You may suffer 1 `damage` to gain 1 `ether`.

*We lift up our arms showing the Locker that we don't mean it any harm. It cautiously crawls to us, sniffs us hesitantly, its giant teeth right next to our heads...*
 
=>***...and licks our faces.*** 

*We shudder in disgust but understand that it doesn't want to hurt us but was just seeking companionship. Its gathered experiences (literally!) will make our journey through this life much easier.*

=><u>Victory.</u> This Slumber ends.

*We gained something precious.*

***"What is eternal is circular and what is circular is eternal."*** --Aristotle

*A long time ago, I realized that our actions now can change not only the future but also the past. The concept of 'now' is like a ring strung on a tapestry of unbroken threads - we can move it back and forth, sideways, up and down, changing the whole layout, and yet only in such a way that the threads running into the future and the past always come together at that one point... 'now'. None of the strands will ever be broken.*

*The combinations are endless and we slowly learned to choose among them moving towards the most desired versions. But this system of threads, of causation and consequence, naturally and immediately always reforms into a coherent stable whole. We can travel in time and change what we want but only within the unknowable rules of this coherent system.*

*We will never go down any path that could really make a difference or create a catastrophic paradox because we will not find that path, because they do not exist.*

*Nobody will ever notice such changes because memory only moves along these threads of time, always assimilating to the current version.*

*And if, by some miracle, you do manage to spot an anomaly - a glitch in the matrix - you can always be sure that sharing this knowledge, in the hopes of changing the world around you, is futile. Because there simply exists no such path where the world has not fallen apart.*

=>Gain 1 `ether`.

# 1176
*Once again, the cardboard man turns out to be completely empty inside, like a plate of armor waiting for its owner.*

*We could take it but is it worth interrupting our comfortable life? It's easier to just follow orders, always stand behind someone, take no responsibility for anything, be like a drifting ship... because we don't want to take the helm of our own lives. However these are only lies we tell ourselves to feel safe. The journey is never easy and we will never reach any destination if we do not start. So, let's put on our armor and finally take control of our destiny.*

=>Gain 1 `gem`. Continue the Slumber.

# 1179
*Dreams of flying - I've known them for a long time.*

*The world turns upside down as my body hurls through the air propelled from an invisible giant's hand. After some time falling turns to flying and an incredible sense of freedom overwhelms me as the cold air flows through my hair. I zoom towards the horizon with seemingly no limits.*

*This freedom is transient however as I always end up colliding into an invisible wall, pain rudely shocking me out of my revelry. Again and again, against my will, my body is thrown into the wall like a raggedy doll. The pain now consumes my thoughts.*

*I cry out,* ***"Stop! I don't want to fly anymore please!",*** *but to no avail. I hear a sinister laugh and then some ominous mumbling before I wake.*

*Sometimes though, the dream is different. It starts off with me falling, fear clutching at all my limbs but then a firm embrace catches me before I hit the ground and lifts me gently up again, over and over. These dreams fill me with comfort.*

*Sometimes flying is truly liberating but at other times it's just a never-ending nightmare.*

=>Gain 1 `ether`.

***"You're scary, you know?,"*** *the child says through chattering teeth.*

*...But it bursts into mischievous laughter and we hear the chattering even louder.*

=>Seal 3 cards. Continue the Slumber

# 1181
*We must accept what we did. It wasn't right but it's too late to change that. Let's no longer look for justification or make excuses - we did it and that's the sad truth. The only thing we can do now is to swear to never make the same mistake again - because let's face it, we can lie to ourselves but the remorse burrows at the back of our minds like an insidious worm. And if we refuse to do this, the consequences will be even worse.*

=><u>Victory.</u> This Slumber ends.

# 1182
*I remember the weeks spent preparing to embark on the journey to other side. Our time was running out quickly and we weren't sure if there was any hope of making it at all. Of all the candidates, we could only choose six people.*

*Of course, knowing what I knew, I had to be one of the chosen. Each remaining member of the group would need to possess powerful internal energies and consciousnesses marked by deep traumas in order to survive the intrusion. They also had to be able to retain remnants of past memories deep within themselves as their minds would be immediately erased after crossing the border. Hidden keys were stored in order for them to unlock and recall this erased knowledge.*

*By examining thousands of objects over many years I had compiled a powerful analytical system that could be the key to our success. As I looked over the cases selected by the system - their tragic flaws and darker backstories spilling onto the screen - I felt a sense of dread. Creeping doubts invaded my mind - does such a ragtag broken team have any chance of surviving at all?* 

*Yet the system chose them in spite of their scars. Or perhaps it was for exactly this reason that it did.*

=>Gain 1 `ether`.

*The power of this beast did not come from nowhere. We nourished her through the ages, strengthening her until she finally overcame her chains. The more she eats, the hungrier she becomes - because this is our gift, which we have given her for a long time. We have long forgotten what we really wanted, we lived believing that to have more is always better and eventually it became the most important thing we desired. We forgot that all of this was only for a few moments before we started over from scratch with nothing again to try and really learn something. However it's easy to lose sight of one's true purpose when we kept on taking and forgetting to give back.*

*Eventually the mindless beast became too powerful to control. Now she rules over us, her power, glorious energy and will - once ours - now turned against us.*

*We fight chaos and decay because that's the nature of our true reality. But thanks to this we also know that nothing truly falls apart forever. Time is an illusion and reality is constantly shifting through many possible combinations - nothing can really die, disappear, or be lost forever. If we are seeking something we will eventually find it - we have enough time.* 

*Any knives are too blunt and too soft to really kill any of us dreamers. Even if it feels like we've met our final demise in one of the worlds, it might be that's actually when the real show just begins on the other side.*

# 1187
*Tricking the puppets feels like trying to resist reaching for another candy, opening an empty fridge once again, or focusing during a boring conversation -* ***it's literally impossible!***

*It's been probably twenty years since I was last here. The building is still standing, but our old company is no more. Someone covered the windows with mouldy cardboard boxes and the derelict square is now overgrown with grass.*

*"What are you looking for here?" an ancient-looking watchman - perhaps he's more than a hundred years old - leans out through a small window on the first floor.*

*If such a person is guarding this place, it might mean that there is nothing else here, and no one cares about it anymore.*

=>**Choose 1:**
- *"Nothing, nothing. We're just passing by."*

=>Block 1 Step on the current Turn card.

- *"We wanted to visit our old workplace. Do you remember the company that used to be here?" We don't have to give the watchman any more encouragement - they have been waiting this whole time for someone to talk to.*

=>Gain **4 Settled Business** from the pool (not

*I know this is where you creep, you shapeless shades! You are like feral animals - ravaneous, rampant, slinking in the dark!*

**Do you really want to mess with Lady Luck?**

=>You may discard the **Nightmare Rift** card or gain 1 `ether`.

# 1196
*So many monstrous creatures feeding upon us, ripping wounds in us and robbing us of all hope. When we try to battle and deny them, their attacks only become more ferocious. When we give in and accept them, harmonising with their movements, they weaken and finally become practically defenseless. This is their secret weakness.*

=>Discard all Morphings if there is any Entity in the Dreamscape or gain 1 `ether` if there is not.

*"You can't deceive me," the conductor says with a shrug. "If you could, the train would be no more."*

***"The atoms or elementary particles themselves are not real; they form a world of potentialities and possibilities rather than one of things or facts."*** - *Werner Heisenberg*

*In the time when we believed that the brain was born of matter and that it created consciousness (and not the other way around), we always divided reality into two parts - matter and consciousness. This strange connection was the source of endless paradoxes, and impossible to explain.Our entire civilization and technology focused on a single life, but only until the moment of death, trying to cut everything that went beyond the material view of the world. The world was somewhat dead at that time.*

*Even when the precursors of a different understanding rediscovered a knowledge forgotten for over a hundred years, civilization was still inertly rolling its old ruts of faith in material foundations. We already knew about the matrix and of the unimaginable scale of the universe we were in, but it was just too hard to believe - being so used to seeing the world around us in an old, naive way.*

*Despite the fact that the more we looked inside the matter particle, the more we found that there was nothing there at all.*

*Despite the fact that we began to see the illusion of time and already had proof of the independence of consciousness from matter and the brain.*

*And that in some subtle and yet uncontrolled way, consciousness effected what we called matter or 'just energy'.*

*It took a global disaster for the world to wake up. But the effects of the awakening were not as good as one would have expected. It is better never to wake up from some dreams...*

*"As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear-headed science - to the study of matter - I can tell you this much as the result of my research on the atoms:-*

***There is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Mind. This Mind is the matrix of all matter."*** - Max Planck

# 1201
*Why do we always scare away new experiences?*

*Why do we treat something novel worse than those things we're already familiar with? Why did we try using a sizzling flame to scare this locker away? Which by the way, ignores it completely.*

*Here and now... Of all people, I am sure that I have lived an infinite number of lives. I feel that not only my body, but also my soul, is aged and exhausted. Only, I am not able to say which memories are mine and which I have already absorbed in the Clinic. They are all as much "mine" as they are "not mine", now just looming somewhere on the edge of vague memories.*

*Among all these images, something unique sometimes appears - the cold world of pure energy, pure and beautiful information. Maybe this is the one closest to me.*

*White pills - I remember them, they used to lie on a cupboard next to a vase of faded flowers... that was a long time ago. The house was already empty then.* 

*Back then I was always too busy - endless training, big competitions, live broadcasts on TV, new contracts...*

*I hadn't visited her for a long time, I rarely found the time to come home and when I finally did, it was already too late.*

*Now I was walking around a vacant, musty apartment - a cold bed, squeaky chairs and bare cabinets. That was all that was left of my life - desolation and bad smells.*

=>If not, continue the Slumber.

# 1207
*With every movement, iron parts and screws fall off the machine whose armor is full of advertisements and video screens. The screens are full of apocalyptic images: atomic explosions, city ruins and primitive communities, a comet on a collision course, machine-like marching troops in gray uniforms, cities surrounded by menacing walls, and a large rostrum at which a non-human being with an absurd moustache gestures angrily. We see a statue of a flat Earth on a pile of burning books, surrounded by dancing figures. And a big "The End" sign. The machine howls so loudly that it is difficult to gather our thoughts.*

*What a voracious creature it is... It devours all that it can steal from us. We decide to take advantage of its greed and fill its gross and insatiable mouth with more waste.

*There are countless variants of the description of the Great Disaster: global atomic war, a slow fall caused by overcrowding and hunger, a climate disaster that sucked oxygen from the atmosphere, the era of hot glow burning the Earth, deadly pandemics, a cosmic collision, an invasion of an inhuman race, a great Judgment - and many others.*

*It was the first time we realized we could remember different pasts, although they all led us to one common here and now. Everyone seems to remember the same early signs of the reality falling apart and the accumulation of anomalies that occurred before the Great Disaster.*

*And yet it all began with the technology that was supposed to help us all. This path began when the new generations finally accepted a different paradigm of the world - where the new science embraced concepts of endless reincarnation cycles and consciousness as foundations for matter.*

*We were no longer just focused on our own singular lifetimes. We wanted to investigate life's true purpose, its expansive experiences, even pushing past the boundaries of death by preserving continuous memory uninterrupted after just mere moments of existence.*

*And if we could influence matter and reality to such a degree - what were our limits? Humanity has never accepted such restrictions.*

*However neither greed nor thirst for power have disappeared. Everyone wanted to buy the power of creation and control it too, of course. Everyone wanted immortality, which was no longer just a vague promise. When quantum mechanics seemed to lead nowhere, we searched other paths.*

*Nobody expected that the humble search programmes would eventually lead us entirely into the world of dreams. So, what made dreams different from reality in this new world that beckoned us on?*

*Not much apparently - and yet within this final frontier was something crucial...*

# 1215
*Rage quickly escapes us. The knocked-down beggar gets up after a while, wiping blood away and staggering as before. Little has changed.*

*We don't have time to deal with them. We know we could tear them apart, but for what? They are, after all, worthless. In fact, we can learn to live with them if we aren't bothered too much by their presence.*

=>This Slumber ends (without Victory or Failure).

# 1216
*All of us who wander here among the mists have lost something. We spend our lives searching for it in between roaring storms, endless labyrinths and abandoned old houses and their cold cellars.*

*The worst part is when you discover that you haven't lost something but rather,* ***someone***. *And it's even worse when it's the one person you only ever wanted to live for.*

*Can we find them anywhere here?*

*A human may fall down many times during their life. It's at these moments when sometimes you hit rock bottom that the world loses all its colours and ceases to make sense.*

hunger, of emptiness and loneliness.*

*This has been my home for several years.*

*I'm reluctant to look at it again because I've almost wiped it from my memory. Now I've come back here once more - to my past - to try and find what I left behind here.*

# 1218
*Cobwebs are strangely familiar to us - every thread is woven from our memories, both good and bad ones. We cannot free ourselves from them.*

*Dark webs obscure our view and restrain our movements and brighter ones ensorcell us and put us to sleep. The more we want to break free from this web, the more tenacious it becomes. No, we don't want to go back there.*

*We want to run away, close our eyes. We can't break through - maybe we are not ready yet, we are still waiting for them to be covered with a thick layer of dust.*

*They always lurk nearby in the darkness, waiting for even just a moment of carelessness. Watch out, for they can strike in an instant leaving only smoking ashes behind.*

I watched their futures in the haze and tried to cheer them up despite seeing that ruthless, inhuman shadow behind them. Theirs was a cruel and merciless fate.*

*Books are my addiction. I've never been able to deny myself another in the hopes that it could help a little with my research. Collecting, cataloguing and curating them has been an obsession in itself. I would like to say a benign one... but we all know that's not really true.* 

*My constant lust for knowledge in the all-encompassing world of thoughts slowly built a suffocating wall around me. And just like Faust, I failed to realise that I had managed to destroy our shared world - our precious home - until it was too late.*

*It wasn't until I found myself walking around an empty house one day that I realized that this time I was truly alone. That this time, I had forever destroyed everything I had loved in this world. And the irony of it all was that I wasn't the one who had suffered the most from all of this.*

*Oh yes, of course I gained something unique - I learned a great secret. But I paid a heavy price and lost someone dear to me forever.*

=>Gain 1 `ether`.

# 1222
*The ancient, deeply rooted fear still sometimes surfaces, though not with the same intensity it used to be in the previous life - in that lost world.* 

*A fear of other people. Almost unfounded...*

*In my mind, I knew that I would have to pay the price for what I had done. And so I waited, leaving the safety of my house less and less. Anyone could be the one to come to reveal my secret. Everyone I passed could my judge, jury and executioner.*

*"This is a beautiful model, an excellent purchase. It's small and you can always carry it with you, even in a small purse. We are adding two boxes of ammunition to this model for free."*

*"Yes, that sounds good. I think I'll take this one."*

*For many years we have tried to forget with every fibre of our being. And we almost succeeded. So why is it coming back now?*

*Hey you! Are you haunting me here - in this strange world of shadows - as a form of punishment?*

# 1227
*It is difficult for us to define what we really are. When we lived our ordinary little life in a 'normal' world, everything was simpler. Today, each of us remembers ourselves not only from our preparation time in the laboratory but also from the normal life that we lived before the catastrophe.*

*Sometimes we remember even earlier or different versions of ourselves from the old days or from other worlds.*

*But there was something else, something that still bothers us now... Are we sure that everyone in our group is really human? Could one of us secretly be a ghost? Or some advanced artificial intelligence? Or an alien behing from a galaxy far, far away? An astronaut drifting through the ages? Or just an animal shapeshifter? Who knows?*

*Long ago, in the heyday of the Clinic, we learned how to implant memories into someone's consciousness. We could pick anybody's life, save their memories and live them ourselves, assimilate them or infuse them into objects. Why were we doing this?*

*I remember erasing and overwriting - experiencing that weird moment when your own life starts to fade away and then this euphoric feeling of "remembering" everything all over again. The power of the emotions at that moment was unlike anything else. Sweet, overpowering and addictive!*

*I was absorbing someone's life just to feel this moment of tearing aside the veil, opening my eyes anew to another **"forgotten"** inner world.*

*When I erased the records, I felt empty - however it was at those moments that my thoughts were the clearest. Everything seemed so simple, so logical. Everything was just a record of data, a structure of numbers and variables. Then... then I was myself once more...*

=>*And I reached for another life to feel human again ... if only just for a moment.*

<u>***What do you do now?***</u> Your Dreamers have to investigate the Dreamworld to find out their identities and their purpose here. Remember those **DREAM GATE TILES** that you took out of the secrets before? Those are the **gates** to **"DREAMS"** (just like the tutorial Dream we just finished) that you can enter and investigate. Think of them like missions or levels of a game.

You have **two** avenues of investigation to start with:- 

- a) Find someone who knows what's going on (**"Not Alone in the Dark"**)
- b) Look inwards and see if you can dig up more pieces of your memory (**"I'll Never Forget those Sunshine Days**)

As our Dreamers commence their exploration on the Awakening space, conveniently located in **Suburbia**, it is recommended that you start with **Not Alone in the Dark** (but of course you can try the other one first if you like).

![Not Alone](/assets/images/secrets/notalone.jpg "Not Alone in the Dark Dream Gate")

Take a look at the **Dream Gate tile** for this Dream. Alongside presenting the *setup information* and a few hints about the Dream, the Dream Gate Tile also tells you about how to **enter it** and what its **requirements** are. In this case, to enter this particular Dream we would need to make our way to the **Dream Gate location space** (`dreamworld-dreamgate`) in **Suburbia** and spend **2 keys** to activate the Gate. We don't have any keys on us at the moment so *let's figure out how to get them*.

You'll notice on the Dreamworld Map that a single location space to the south of the map has a **little key** (`dreamworld-key`) symbol. By moving to this location you immediately obtain **1 key**. There are *other ways* to obtain keys of course (eg. within Dreams, through item cards and influence cards) but for now this is most likely the only way available to you. What this means is that you will need to do a ***loop around Suburbia*** in order to get the **2 keys** you need. This will slowly introduce you to all the other mechanics.

When you have these keys, go back to the **Dream Gate location** and **discard them** in order to "**enter the Dream**", following **setup** similar to how we set up the *First Dream*.

<u>**NAVIGATING THE DREAMWORLD**</u>

![Dreamworld](/assets/images/secrets/dreamworld.jpg "Dreamworld Map")

The **DREAMWORLD** is like a global bird's eye map of where your team is currently located. Starting with your team marker on the **AWAKENING** space, you will move it around following the **big arrows** until you reach other locations with map icons. These are one-way paths and you normally cannot go backwards against the direction of the arrow.

![Dreamworld Big Arrow](/assets/images/secrets/map-large-arrow.jpg "Big Arrow")

**Smaller arrows** are shortcuts and usually have a cost listed on the map area. In the case of **Suburbia**, if your team were to travel on these routes, you would need to "**Flip (an active progress card) or Seal 1 Card"**.

![Dreamworld Small Arrow](/assets/images/secrets/map-small-arrow.jpg "Small Arrow")

You'll notice that from the **AWAKENING** space you have potentially 2 pathways to head to - the one to the right will lead you into a location with 2 symbols (**a Fate Card symbol** `dreamworld-fate` and a **Slumber Deck symbol** `dreamworld-slumber`) while the left path will lead you to a location with only 1 symbol (`dreamworld-fate`). You can pick either path and then move your **team marker** to that space. Unlike movement on the **Dreamscape** (where you're moving your Dreamer miniatures), movement on the **Dreamworld map** is ***freely*** done (except for **shortcuts**).

Regardless of whichever path you picked, the moment you enter a location with symbols you resolve them from left to right.

# 133.2
<u>**FATE CARDS**</u>`dreamworld-fate`

- `dreamworld-fate` - Draw the top card of the **FATE** deck and resolve it. Some Fate card effects occur right away and give you penalties or bonuses, whilst others cause a new **SLUMBER MAP TILE** to be placed. These latter ones are a bit more complicated so we'll cover them here.

![Fate Example](/assets/images/secrets/fate_example.jpg "Fate_example")

- If you look at the Fate card above (**"The Strange Hood"**), you'll see that at the very top it tells you to **Draw and place 1 Dreamscape Slumber (map) Tile**. We already placed the **2 Starting Ones** earlier so if you happened to draw this card, you would draw another Dreamscape Tile and position it on the **corresponding Dreamscape board space**. As with placing all map tiles, pay attention to placing it so that the designation (eg. C4) matches the label on the board. If you do this correctly ***you should always be able to access the map tile*** from the 2 starting tiles. 

![Dreamscape Setup Example](/assets/images/secrets/dreamscape-setup.jpg "Dreamscape Setup")
- ***This is an example of a more elaborate Dreamscape map (yours will not look like this just yet!) but shows how to place these tiles.***


- You'll also notice with this particular Fate card, it mentions that if the Dreamscape Slumber Tile has a **QUIRK** slot (you can see a close-up example below) you'll place this card there. From now on the **"Quirk effect"** affects the ***whole*** Dreamscape. **Strange Hood** would cause you to have to resolve **"Each Dreamer Seals 1 Card"** every time there is a **"Special Effect"** on the **TURN CARDs** *(on top of whatever effects the Entity performs as well)*. 

![Quirk Example](/assets/images/secrets/quirk-example.jpg "Quirk Example")

- Obviously this is potentially very detrimental to your Dreamers but you can see that the card gives you an option to remove it by performing an **Assault 8**`red` `player-x`/**Contact 4**`green` `player-x` action while you are in the relevant quirk space (marked with a **small circle** - see below). Note in this situation you ***cannot*** apply the normal range (of 1) for **Assault/Contact actions** - you need to actually be on the Quirk space. ***But why bother having the action labelled as Assault/Contact then?!*** Some of your **influence** and **item cards** allow you to more efficiently obtain `green` and `red` for **Assault/Contact** actions so it may be an idea to use them here.

![Quirk Space](/assets/images/secrets/quirk-space.jpg "Quirk Space")

- One more thing - you may not encounter this until later but keep it in the back of your mind! You'll also notice on some Dreamscape Slumber map tiles this symbol:

![Gem slot](/assets/images/secrets/gemslot.jpg "Gem Slot")

When you're on a space with this symbol you can spend **1** `gem` and place it on that symbol to activate the effect associated with it. If you're on the same space, you may also choose to take the `gem` but this will deactivate the effect.

- [Go back to] -> (133.1)

# 133.3
<u>**SLUMBER CARDS**</u>`dreamworld-slumber`

![Slumber](/assets/images/secrets/slumber.jpg "slumber")

`dreamworld-slumber` - Draw the top card of the **SLUMBER** deck and resolve it. Be careful not to confuse this deck with the **SLUMBER DREAMSCAPE TILES** - the **SLUMBER deck** has a *vivid red back* and large word (**SLUMBER**) written on it. The Slumber deck consists of *encounters* that your Dreamers bump into while moving from location to location in the Dreamworld. Some encounters are hostile and force your Dreamers to face Entities on the Slumber Dreamscape map, whilst some are benign and give your Dreamers some breathing room to setup and recover resources.

At the current moment you have ***no influence cards in your hand*** - the only way to obtain these is to enter a Slumber where you will have a normal **TURN** structure (**Dreamers Phase**, **Dreamscape Phase**) and be able to draw and play cards.

As your Dreamers are just starting out, you'll find that many of the Slumber Cards *will not do anything* but check to see whether you have a certain number of **Active Progress Cards** in play before ***"ending the Slumber"***. The moment you satisfy the criteria on these cards, go to the Secret Script entry on the cards.

The main **ENTITY** that you will meet in the Slumber Deck is the **WRAITH**. The moment you ***draw this slumber encounter*** [go to] -> (133.6) - You may want to write this entry down somewhere to make it convenient for you to return to it.

Lastly, the last Slumber card (**the Green One**) is a special Slumber encounter. This Slumber is called **"The DELTA PHASE"**. When you reveal it, follow the instructions on the card. We won't really talk about it except to say that it will be a very pleasant surprise and provides a means for your Dreamers to **recover** without having to **Awaken**. 

- [Go back to] -> (133.1)

# 133.4
<u>**SHOPPING**</u>`dreamworld-shopping`

When you visit these locations you may discard **one of the Shopping Cards** that was issued to you at the end of the last Dream in order to obtain either more **influence cards** for your Dreamer's deck or more **Items** to your storage.

**If you choose to obtain influence cards:**
- Each dreamer draws **3 cards** from the influence deck and can buy as many as they like paying the required `ether` listed on the top right of the card. These cards enter your discard pile (to be used when you reshuffle). If you choose not to buy any cards, gain **1** `gem`.

**If you choose to buy an item from the Item Market** (note that at this point there may be no items in the item market, especially if you discovered all of the ones from the Tutorial Dream):
- Each dreamer may draw **1 random item** from the Item Market and buy it for **2** `ether`. As above, if you choose not to buy any cards, gain **1** `gem`.

Afterwards the used shopping card is returned to the Secrets. Generally you will receive more on successful completion of Dreams.

- [Go back to] -> (133.1)

# 133.5
<u>**SANCTUARY LOCATION**</u>`dreamworld-sanctuary`

If you land on these special locations you can choose **one** of these to do:

- **Reshuffle** your influence deck ***without penalty*** (normally you would need to take **1**`damage` or **Seal 3 cards**)

- Unflip **1 progress card**

- **Unseal 1 chosen card**

- **Restore 1 item**

You'll find a reminder printed on the **Dreamworld Map Wisdom card**.

- [Go back to] -> (133.1)

# 133.6
![wraith](/assets/images/secrets/wraith.jpg "wraith")

**The Wraith Behind my Back** is the first hostile **ENTITY** you will encounter in the Dreamworld. The moment you reveal this card you will: 

1. Place your Dreamers on the `start` spaces on the **Slumber Dreamscape map**.

2. Construct the **Turn Deck** to the indicated number of turns on the **ENTITY tile** (in this case 4 turn cards), turning the top-most card face up.

3. **Spawn the Wrath** (the card tells you to use the Wraith miniature, if you do not have it you can use the Wraith token or substitute a Creature/Human Shapeshifter miniature instead). The location it spawns on is determined by the TURN card - if you have revealed a **TURN SUIT** (`spades`/`hearts`/`clubs`/`diamonds`) that matches one of the `spawn` spaces, it will spawn in that space. Otherwise, if the relevant turn suit `spawn` space is not present it will spawn on the generic one (`spawn`). 

If you examine the entity tile you can see that there are potentially *3 ways* to ***"End the Slumber"***:-

 - ***Chase out the wraith***: When it is **not** on a `night` space your Dreamers can **Assault 6**`red` `player-x` **OR** **6**`yellow` `player-x` (in range 1). Doing this would gain you the **"Loot"** listed on the faceup turn card (the turn you managed to do this). Note that to succeed, you would need to contribute a total of **6** `red` `player-x` **OR** **6** `yellow` `player-x` but **not** in a combination of the two if playing with multiple players. 

 - ***Run out of Turns***: If you have gone through all 4 Turns and have not been able to chase out the Wraith you will get *caught* (and resolve s.770).

 - **Decide to skip the encounter entirely**: You can only do this **BEFORE** you start your **DREAMERS phase** (so you do not draw cards if you decide to skip.) You are also caught and resolve s.770.

Remember that the entity will act in the **"DREAMSCAPE PHASE"** (after all the Dreamers have acted) and follow what is displayed on the **TURN** card. [See **ENTITY TURN**] -> (248) and [**MORPHINGS**] -> (248.1) for a reminder about how this works. 

You'll also notice that there is a special action you can do in this encounter - Dreamers can spend 7 `green` to place 1 `light` on their tile. `light` ***cancels*** out the effects of `night`... There are other ways to generate `light` of course and some of the spaces on the map tiles don't have `night` on them to begin with...

When you end the Slumber, note that your Dreamers ***do not get removed off the Dreamscape Map*** - they stay where they are currently to begin in the same positions in the next Slumber Encounter.

***This little elf tells you to ignore Deliverance for now - it doesn't concern you yet!***

# 248.1
**MORPHINGS** - It is recommended that you write this entry number down **(248.1)** if you require a reference to the Morphing Effects later. Alternatively, the back of the rulebook has a list of what morphing token effects do.

**MORPHINGS** (applied during the step on **TURN ORDER** cards) add a boost to the Entity, making it stronger and more dangerous as long as the token is on the **ENTITY TILE**. When you add 1 or more **MORPHING TOKENS**, draw them randomly and place them face up on the Entity tile. It is recommended you use a *small cup* or *opaque bag* to do this but you could also place them face down and draw randomly.

![Morphinglist](/assets/images/secrets/morphinglist.jpg "Morphinglist")



# 326.1
**THE LAST THING**

If you look at your **Player Aid card** (it's been mostly forgotten off to the side until now) you'll notice a few other basic actions that we haven't covered:

- **EFFORT**: "**HOURS**" are essentially a special type of resource that you can use to either gain **extra movement** (once a turn (at any time) by losing **X hours**, you can move **X spaces**) or to buy **extra time** for you to complete a Dream (**1 hour can be traded in for an extra turn**). You won't have any yet but will get some later. If you are using the board there is an assigned space for this (the clock). Otherwise you can use a normal 6-sided die or another token (eg. some coins) to track this.

- **PEEK A CARD**: Discard **1** influence card from your hand in order to take a 5-second peek at **1** secret card/tile from the current Dream's secrets with a  Influence/Item/Flaw/Fate/Slumber back (at any time). Some of these types of cards you won't know about yet (and will be explained later) but suffice to say this is a good way to "**scout**" ahead, especially if you have excess cards you don't know how to use. 

- **GAIN A SHINING GEM**: Discard **3 influence cards** to obtain a `gem` if it's available (at any time).

- **REMOVE MORPHINGS**: Remove **1 Key** or **1** `ether` to discard **1 Morphing** at any time. Both of these resources you won't have just yet but you've learnt a little about **Morphings** [before] -> (248.1). This is another important ability to remember, especially when the Entities start becoming more difficult.

# 450.1
***Firstly don't worry too much if the card abilties seem too complicated for you for now or talk about things you don't understand just yet (eg. Delta Phase)*** - you can get by this whole tutorial without using them and with more play, you will gradually start to learn about your Dreamer's capabilities, weaknesses and strengths. But by all means if you understand them right away, feel free to use them!

- Some card abilties have **costs** that you will need to pay in order to carry out their effects. Take the card below ("Effort") for example:

![Effort card](/assets/images/secrets/effort-card.jpg "Effort card")

You can see that the "cost" in this case is that your Dreamer will have to take **1** `damage` in order to gain **3** `red` intent. The small lightning bolt symbol on top of the cost means that it can be played at any time.

- Other cards will have require you to ***Seal*** cards in order to gain their effect. Take the card below ("**Hesitation**") for example:

![Hesitation card](/assets/images/secrets/hesitation-card.jpg "Hesitation card")

This card allows you to **Seal** it in order to obtain **3** `red`, `yellow` or `green` intent (very useful!). [To read more about Sealing/Reshuffling cards go to] -> (450.2). Sealing cards isn't ideal as these cards are out of your deck and will not return unless they are ***unsealed*** - this is much harder to do than ***reshuffling*** when your deck runs out.

- Some Influence cards are special in that they are known as **Progress Cards**. These are more useful abilities that can be put down underneath your Dreamer board in order to give you more flexibility in how you navigate Dreamscapes. These cards usually have a colored "aura" around them. Take for example, **Self-Improving Tools** (one of the ***Tough Guy's Unique progress cards***):

![Self improve card](/assets/images/secrets/self-improve-card.jpg "Self improve card")

This card is placed underneath your Dreamer board for **4** `red` intent (or you could discard it for **1** `red` intent to do something else). Once it's in your area it becomes an **"Active Progress Card"** and you may only have ***a maximum of 4*** of these out at any time (including if they've been flipped - or disabled - by some other effect). To use this card once it's been placed, you need to spend **3** `green` intent which allows you to place **1** `marker` on it **OR** eventually once you've saved enough `marker` on it you may spend **3** `green` to discard them all for **3** `red` each (allowing you to do a massive wallop to something...). 

Some rules reference `green-progress`/`yellow-progress`/`red-progress` - these refer to the number of **ACTIVE (placed) PROGRESS cards** of the corresponding color (flipped disabled cards don't count).

- Finally all Dreamers have access to their ***own special abilities*** when they are visible on the card backs of their Influence Deck. For example, the Gambler has:

![Dreamer ability](/assets/images/secrets/dreamer-ability.jpg "Dreamer ability")

All of the Gambler's starting influence cards have this ability on their backs. When this is visible you can spend **1** `yellow` intent in order to discard the card (off the top of your influence deck) and reroll **1** of your rolls. Note that as you start to remove these cards or add other cards to/from the Influence Market to your deck, you may find that you won't have access to these abilities quite so often. 

[Go back to] -> (450)


# 450.2
### Sealing

Sealing means that each affected Dreamer has to move the top card from their Influence deck to a personal **Sealed cards** pile. This is worse than **Discarding**, since cards from your **Discard pile** will eventually go back into your deck more quickly when you **Reshuffle**. However, cards from the Sealed pile do **not** get reshuffled. They don't go back until the game allows you to take them back - to **Unseal** them - and are temporarily unavailable to you for longer. It's not a pleasant effect, but you'll need to learn to manage it, as it's one of the most common effects in this game. Note that if you have ***less than 6 cards*** in your play area (discard, hand and influence deck; sealed cards and active progress cards do not count) - you will **die** (see below). 

We recommend you place your **sealed cards** under your unused *Mask* - which you'll get later.

Both `damage` and **Sealed cards** define how *tired*, *discouraged*, and *wounded* your Dreamer is as their inner resources are sapped away from them.

### Unsealing

Unsealing works in the opposite way to Sealing. When the game instructs you to **unseal** cards you take them from the top of the **Sealed card** pile and place them into your **DISCARD pile**.

### Reshuffling

Eventually you will run out of cards to draw from your **INFLUENCE DECK**. When this happens, draw what you can and then **RESHUFFLE** your **DISCARD** pile to reform your deck. Unfortunately this also ***comes at a cost*** - choose to suffer 1 `damage` or **SEAL 3 CARDS** (after reshuffling) to signify your dreamer's continuing exhaustion.

### Death

If your dreamer suffers their **8th** `damage` or has ***fewer than 6 cards*** (not including sealed or active progress cards) they will die. [Read the **DEATH entry** on the **DREAM GATE TILE** for the 1st Dream] -> (922) or **II-42 I - Death Wisdom Card** for other Dreams). This is very unlikely to happen in this particular dream but (mis)fortune is a fickle mistress...

[Go back to] -> (450)


# 450.3
### Boosting intent

Why might you need to roll any dice at all, hmmm? One of the available things that a Dreamer can do is that they can **"BOOST INTENT"**. This is a push-your-luck mechanism in order to get more intent than you spent. It is available only **once** per dreamer every turn* by rolling the **LUCK DIE** when you spend at least **1 INTENT**. This is *optional* but must always be the ***last source*** of adding Intent to an action.

![Luck die](/assets/images/secrets/luck-die.png "Luck die")

**If you roll**:

- `luck-x`: **Fail** to perform the action and *don't reclaim discarded influence cards*. Also discard **1** `ether` or suffer **1** `damage` or **SEAL 3 cards**.

- `luck-blank`: No additional intent added. If the action fails, don't reclaim discarded influence cards.

- `luck-1`/`luck-2`/`luck-3`: Add **1** / **2** / **3** Intent of the same colour.

[Go back to] -> (450)

*Remember that a **TURN** is one **DREAMERS PHASE** followed by a **DREAMSCAPE PHASE** and is represented by a **TURN CARD**.

# 450.4
**DREAMSCAPE PHASE/ ENTITY TURN**

Right now there probably isn't an **ENTITY** (think of them like the enemies for now) on the map so you can ignore most of this phase (and everything listed on the current face-up **TURN CARD**) for now, discarding it (**face down**), revealing the next one and just skipping towards starting another **DREAMERS PHASE** by *drawing 4 influence cards again* (up to your 6-card hand limit). Remember that you only draw as many cards as it takes to bring your hand size to 6 cards (eg. so if you had 4 cards in hand, you would only draw 2 more cards) and can discard as many cards as you want ***before*** you draw.
