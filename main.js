  0.95: "<u>**TURN ORDER**</u>\n\nA **TURN** consists of a **DREAMERS PHASE** followed by a **DREAMSCAPE PHASE**:\n\n**A) DREAMERS PHASE**\n\n1. **DRAW STEP**\n    - Each Dreamer draws **4 influence cards** but only up to their **hand limit** - ***the basic hand limit is 6 cards***. *Eg. If you had 3 cards, you would draw only 3 cards as you would hit your hand limit of 6 cards, similarly if you had 5 cards, you would only draw 1 card and if you had 6 cards you would not draw any cards.*\n    - You can ***never*** have more cards in your hand than your **hand size limit** including when other card effects allow you to draw cards into your hand.\n    - Before you draw you may discard ***any*** number of cards from your hand.\n    - A Dreamer cannot choose to draw ***less*** cards than required.\n    If you run out of cards to draw from your influence deck, reshuffle your **Discard Pile** creating a new deck, incur the penalty - *suffer* **1** `damage` *or* ***Seal 3 cards*** *from the top of the deck immediately after reshuffling* - and draw the rest of the required cards.\n\n2. **CARD AND ACTION STEP**\n    - Dreamers perform actions and play cards. \n    \n    If you prefer a structured turn order: \n    - Beginning with the First Player and going clockwise, each Dreamer performs a **round** where they perform only one Dream action - either a Map Action, Dream Gate tile action, Dream Secret action or Entity Tile interaction - followed by any number of other actions (eg. Move, Basic Actions, Influence, active Item cards etc) and other activities (eg. placing Progress cards, gaining shining `gem` etc). Take as many rounds as you want until everybody passes in a row. If you pass you may still continue to play in later rounds (of the same Turn) whenever you wish.\n\n    **Recommended**: You can play without worrying about player's order and rounds until a specific situation calls for play order.\n\n**B) DREAMSCAPE PHASE**\n\n1. **ENTITY AND DREAM EVENT STEP**\n    - The current **TURN** card specifies which effects of this Dream are resolved and in what order. These effects may be found on the Entity tile, Dream Gate tile, quirk cards or other Secret cards.\n    - In some of the Slumbers/Dreams, additional effects can take place independently of the Turn card.\n    \n",
  0.96: "**Fate cards**\n\nFate cards are drawn from `dreamworld-fate` locations on the Dreamworld map. After resolving them, unless otherwise stated, place them at the bottom of the Fate deck. Fate cards are short interludes, small adventures or events that will sometimes ask you to make a choice. Each fate card will contain all the rules needed to resolve it.\n\nSome Fate cards tell you (at the very top of the card in a white frame) to draw **1 Slumber Map tile** (if possible) and place it on the Dreamscape. Then, if there is any empty Quirk space (labelled on the map tile), place that Fate card there. Fate cards with these instructions are named **Quirk cards**.",
  0.97: '<u>**THE DREAMWORLD MAP**</u>\n\n**Travelling through the Dreamworld**\n\n[see:](133) (**Shortly after exiting the First Dream**)\n\nThere are no turns in moving on the Dreamworld map and normal movement does not typically have a cost unlike movement on the Dreamscape (with the exception of **shortcuts** - below). \n\nAlways choose one of the paths and move the Team Marker to the next location, following the path\'s direction (arrowheads). These directions are one-way only. After entering a **Location**, resolve its effect (represented by an icon or short rule on it). If there are more than one effect, resolve them *one by one from left to right*.\n\n**Shortcuts** are represented by smaller narrow arrows on the Dreamworld. Using them has a cost which is different for each Dreamworld Map tile. When taking a shortcut between two different Dreamworld Map tiles, *resolve the Shortcut effect of the tile you start from.*\n\n**Using Influence Cards and Items on the Dreamworld Map**\n\nWhilst influence cards and items are mostly used in Slumbers/Dreams and not on the Dreamworld Map, there are some exceptions. These cards are specified as such and modify the rules for travelling on the Dreamworld Map or the resolution of Location effects. Some cards, while not specifically reserved to the Dreamworld, can be played if they have an effect (such allowing rerolls) that is useful (eg. such as resolving a Fate card).\n\nAll of the "Once per Turn" actions/ effects can be used only once during each travel between Slumbers/Dreams on the Dreamworld Map.\n\nNote that to use such Influence cards, you must have them in your hand (or have such Progress cards in your Progress zone) as there are **no Draw steps on the Dreamworld Map**. This might be a good reason to end a Slumber/Dream with such cards in hand.\n\n',

  dreamers:
    '### CHOOSING YOUR DREAMERS\n\nEach player chooses one of the Dreamers below and takes the Dreamer\'s corresponding **Influence Deck**, **Miniature** and **Dreamer Board**. Take your **Dreamer\'s Influence Deck**, **shuffle it** and place it face down to the left of your Dreamer board. Be careful ***not*** to take the special "Lucid Dreamer" board (the "lighter" coloured board) or miniature - these are unlocked later as the game progresses. Each Dreamer has a ***few unique cards*** in their deck that influence their starting play-style. Every Dreamer also has a different backstory - revealed as the game progresses.\n\n![Dreamerboard](/assets/images/secrets/dreamerboard.png "Dreamer-Board")\n\nIf you are playing **solo**, you can either:\n\n- **Choose** ***one*** **Dreamer**: This is easier for now as you only need to keep track of one deck of cards and is recommended for the First Dream to learn how the core game mechanics work. Later on you can add an additional Dreamer and play "two-handed", tracking 2 influence decks and hands. Some **Dreams** ("missions" or "levels" in the game essentially) are much easier or much harder with one Dreamer.\n\n- **Play *two* Dreamers straight away**: If you have experience with other deck building games this is recommended as it adds an additional level of variety. Any more than 2 Dreamers becomes quite difficult to manage but if you want to try this later on, you\'re welcome to.\n\nDon\'t worry too much about your choice of Dreamers for now - later on you\'ll be able to switch them so just go with whichever one appeals to you.\n\n### THE GAMBLER\n\n![Gambler](/assets/images/token-gambler.png "Gambler")\n\n***The Gambler*** is a good choice if you like to play with fate and roll dice, relying somewhat on luck but with some ability to mitigate it. She likes to deceive others but considers it a game - not something serious at all! She has a problem with understanding the gravity of the situation and, even when she does, prefers ignorance - pretending that there is no problem at all. \n\n### THE SPECIALIST\n\n![Specialist](/assets/images/token-specialist.png "Specialist")\n\n***The Specialist*** is an expert engineer and craftsman. He relies on using Progress cards to provide him with constant bonuses throughout the game and is the most effective at constructing a powerful engine. He prefers peaceful discourse and in-depth analysis over fast or brutal solutions, and has gathered more knowledge than the rest of the Dreamers combined, often becoming the de facto leader of the group.\n\n### THE TOUGH GUY\n\n![Tough Guy](/assets/images/token-tough-guy.png "Tough Guy")\n\n***The Tough Guy*** is tenacious and resilient, preferring brute force to solve problems. He dislikes diplomacy and is often impatient with complicated solutions, often preferring the simplest direct approach. Despite his gruff exterior, he has a heart of gold and won\'t hesitate to go so far as sacrificing himself should the need arise. Cool and composed under pressure (unless something unleashes his fury), you can always rely on him when you\'re in trouble.\n\n### THE FREE SPIRIT\n\n![Free Spirit](/assets/images/token-free-spirit.png "Free Spirit")\n\n***The Free Spirit*** likes to bend the rules! She doesn\'t accept any limitations or rigid laws and enjoys carving her own path through the Dream World. She is the most in tune with her soul and inner consciousness but sometimes this causes her to act rather childishly, often placing less priority on her physical body. \n\n### THE REAPER\n\n![Reaper](/assets/images/token-reaper.png "Reaper")\n\n***The Reaper*** uses emotional and physical distress to her advantage, encouraging a higher risk-reward playstyle. They say that the Reaper was once called Delight but eventually misfortune tainted her soul, twisting happiness into despair and hatred. She eventually learned to leverage this pain, shaping her suffering into a scythe that enables her to use her Distress to her advantage. Be wary though, her blade has two very sharp edges...\n\nOnce you\'ve chosen your Dreamer(s), you can enter your first dream.\n\nContinue by clicking on the **FIRST DREAM** button.\n',

    '### ENTERING THE FIRST DREAM\n\nFind <u>**TILE I-01 X**</u> and place it into play. This is a **DREAM GATE TILE** and it\'s how you enter "Dreams".\n\n![Dream Gate](/assets/images/secrets/dream-gate.jpg "Dream Gate")\n\nThe "**SETUP:**" portion of the tile tells you to take all **I-01 secret cards and tiles**. Find all the corresponding **cards** and **tiles** (that you hopefully sorted earlier) and place them nearby. Remember that **TILES** are the larger square "cards". So you should have:\n\n- **CARDS**: I-01 - A, B, C, D\n- **TILES**: I-01 - SETUP, S, T, V, W, Y, Z\n\nNow it tells you to **REVEAL THE SETUP TILE**. Take the one marked **"I-01 SETUP"** and place it in the **DREAMSCAPE** section of the board (the top section). When you place this **TILE** down, make sure to align the **A2** code in its top left with the **A2** code on the board. Alternatively if you\'re not using the board, you can place it in front of you. This is a **MAP TILE** and is a representation of the Dream World your dreamers currently find themselves in. \n\n![Map Tile](/assets/images/secrets/secret-tile.jpg "Map Tile")\n\nNow go back to the **DREAM GATE TILE** - you\'ll notice that it also has listed on it **"TURN DECK"** and **"INTRODUCTION"**. \n\nWe set up the turn deck earlier with **12 cards** already, but some Dreams start with fewer turns (in which case you randomly shuffle and deal out the stated number). Turns represent how much time you have to complete a dream by achieving its **Victory Condition**. \n\nYou\'ll also see next to **INTRODUCTION - a script reference (450)**. Ordinarily, for all Dreams you would go to the Book of Secret Scripts (or use this app) to read this entry first, as it introduces you to the setting and what your Dreamers are doing here. For now, ***don\'t do that yet*** and quickly flip the Tile over:\n\n- <u>**The Goal of the Dream:**</u> In this case it\'s to learn the basics. In later Dreams, this area will have vague hints as to how you achieve their victory condition. Sometimes this might be more obscure, relying on exploration to figure this out. \n\n- <u>**SPECIAL RULES:**</u> That only apply to the Dream you are in. In this case for this tutorial Dream if you were to ***die*** to turn to **Script 922**. We\'ll cover the rules about dying later, but suffice to say you won\'t be dying any time soon... hopefully.\n\n- <u>**OUT OF TURNS:**</u> If you run out of turns before achieving the Victory condition, read the script entry here (**425**).\n\nKeep this side of the tile face up and place it in the corresponding spot on the board or off to the side (if not using the board).\n\nNow remember the **INTRODUCTION** that we skipped before?\n\nTo continue either click on **CAMPAIGN** button here or in main menu.

  guide:
    "<u>**TIPS AND TRICKS**</u> - Adapted from the official guide AR released\n\n**GENERAL ADVICE**\n\nWhenever you find yourself in a situation where you think you cannot do anything, see if any of the following might be a solution to go forward:\n- \\- cards on hand (both for their Intent and actions),\n- \\- your Dreamer's special ability visible on the back of their Influence deck,\n- \\- actions listed on the Basic Actions cards (e.g., discarding 3 cards to gain a Shining Gem, discarding Morphing tokens, peeking on the Secret card)\n- \\- Boosting your Intent by rolling the Luck die,\n- \\- using your Shining Gems,\n- \\- using your Mask ability,\n- \\- using any of the Wisdom cards you have,\n- \\- using any of the Progress cards you have placed,\n- \\- using any of the active Items (either for its Intent or Action),\n- \\- using the Clock (either to move or to add a Turn card),\n- \\- looking for a Sign token match,\n- \\- looking for any hints hidden in the Dreamscape (be it written or graphic),\n\nLast but not least: If you cannot do precisely what you want, try to use your resources to do something else which might seem helpful, like moving to an advantageous location, placing a new Progress card, preparing yourself for upcoming Turns, or trying to stay safe from the current Turn's effects.\n\n**DON't FORGET YOUR MASK**\n\n- Your masks' effects have a significant bearing on the game. Masks' abilities allow you to avoid a lot of penalties while paying relatively low costs. Keep in mind that, during the Awakening, you may exchange your mask for any other mask you have. It may be useful to change your mask to better suit your deck or help you in the upcoming Dream.\n\n**BALANCE YOUR DECK**\n\nWhen you play solo, or in a pair, it is wise not to overspecialize your deck. If both players have aggressive `red` heavy decks, they might have a problem when they encounter creatures that require `green` to overcome. Remember that you can always rebuild your deck during **Awakening**. Sometimes it is useful to rebuild it completely, especially if you are trying to complete the Dream you have failed previously.\n\n**NOT ALL CARDS ARE NEEDED**\n\nWell, most of them are pretty useful, but some might not fit your particular deck. When you gain a new card, you should think whether it compliments your deck and your playstyle. ***The more cards you have in your deck, the smaller chance you will draw useful cards in any given situation. But if you have a tiny deck, you will run out of cards sooner, and you will suffer Distress and Seal cards more often***. It is good to be moderate about your card count and keep about 30 in the deck. With more of them, the availability of your Dreamer's special ability decreases also.\n\n**SHINING GEMS ARE USEFUL**\n\nThese Shiny Gems are quite versatile. They allow you to reroll **ANY** die (even this pesky Entity Movement Die). Even the most powerful Entity stops being a threat if it moves slowly and cannot catch the Dreamers. When you find yourself with too many cards on your hand, and you have no way to use them, always ***discard three cards to gain 1 Shining Gem***. It will come in handy, trust us!\n\n**ETHER IS A COMMON CURRENCY**\n\nYou may think that Ether is a precious resource, but when you have a couple of additional cards in your deck, consider other uses for it. You may ***spend Ether to discard Morphings from those Entities*** you find challenging to deal with. You may spend it to remove particularly nasty Flaws from your deck. You may also buy new Items in the market - any Items you could not find in a Dream go to that market so it will be full of useful stuff in no time.\n\n**ITEMS ARE A POWERHOUSE**\n\nItems are not only a terrific Intent boost, but they have their own effects. Those effects significantly impact the gameplay, allowing you to speed it up, avoid unwanted Slumbers, generate additional keys or just make your adventures easier in general.\nAnother thing: you do not have to discard many of the Items after use! Read their effects carefully. Most of the time, discard is an effect of a bad die roll. Only the most powerful ones are discarded each time you use them. You do have to discard an Item always if you use it for its Intent.\n\n**LUCK DIE AND BOOSTING YOUR INTENT**\n\nIt is useful to sometimes boost your Intent using a Luck die. Many effects (like Actions, Items, Masks, or Shining Gems, to name but a few) in the game grant you die rerolls, so do not hesitate to use it. Even if you see that you do not have enough Intent for an Action, you may try to perform it by spending less and rolling the Luck die.\n\n<u>**SLUMBERS**</u>\n\nSLUMBERS ARE GOOD FOR YOU...\n\nThey are, especially when you start a new gaming session. Rushing into\na Dream without having Progress cards played on the table is not the best\nidea. It will make completing the Dream longer and more difficult. Always\ntry to have at least basic Progress of your Dreamer played. They are usually\nwhat makes certain Dreamers \u201ctick\u201d.\n\n\u2026EASY SLUMBERS ARE EVEN BETTER!\n\nUse those well known, easy Slumbers to prepare for the demanding\nDreams. Vanquishing your enemies, breaking them, and leaving their corpses\nbehind is not required in most of the Slumbers.\nTry to use all the Turn cards you have for a particular Slumber or finish\nit when the card shows a really good Loot. Use the remaining time to gather\nShining Gems, play Progress cards, and activate useful Items. Just try to\nkeep your distance from the Entities (and do not hesitate to spend a Shining\nGem to reroll a Movement Die if the Entity is too fast for you). You can also\nuse one of the Dreamers as bait - especially if the Entity has an effect that\ncould affect everyone in the range.\n\nSKIPPING CAN BE WORTHWHILE\n\nBe reasonable about your chances in a Slumber. If you find it too hard, do\nnot be afraid to use the option to Skip it. Most of the time, its effects will be\nless harsh than any punishment you might suffer trying to defeat the Entity.\nIf you want to avoid some Slumbers, it is useful to have an Item of a \u201cVehicle\u201d\ntype. Try to have at least one always active.\n\nTO REMOVE UNWANTED SLUMBERS ...\n/SPOILER ALERT/\n\nDeliverance is a really useful option. It requires a Wisdom card, but it allows you to remove or\nchange particularly nasty Slumbers. If you are not sure which approach to use against a Slumber,\nalways try to Understand it first. It cannot hurt!\n\nTURN CARDS ARE OPEN INFORMATION\n\nUse the Turn cards to your advantage. Always read the current Turn card\ncarefully. Sometimes the order of the Entity\u2019s actions will let you avoid the\nadverse effects. When the order is that Entity first takes its Morphing/Basic/\nSpecial Action and moves afterward, all you have to do is keep your distance.\nThis way, you can keep exploring the Dreamscape or prepare for the next turn.\nIt would help if you also had the Loot in mind. It changes between the\ncards, making it sometimes preferable to prolong Slumber or finish it quicker\nto gain the most useful things.\n\nDREAMS\nLOOK CAREFULLY\nWhenever something catches your eye on the Dreamscape, check it out. It\nmay be a secret or a hint. Carefully consider all texts written in a different font.\nWhen you are exploring a Dream, try to check everything you can. Sometimes\nyou can finish a Dream very quickly, but the rewards are mediocre.\nIt is because most powerful cards are usually hidden in the Dream itself.\nA thorough exploration of Dreams will allow you to better understand them\nand gain more knowledge about the world of Etherfields.\nWe put a lot of effort into the game\u2019s atmosphere and dreamy feeling, so\nwe would advise you to try and roleplay your Dreamers a bit and enjoy the\ngame, not only in a mechanical sense.\nCHECK YOUR NOTES!\nWhenever you are entering a Dream, be sure to check all the Note cards\nyour party might have. In your previous Dreams, you might have gained\nsomething really important for the task at hand. They might make finishing\na current Dream so much easier or grant you a special reward.\nIf you find out that you have no idea how to progress in a Dream, check\nthe back of the Dream Gate Tile, it may have a tip or a particular rule you\nforget about.\nYOU ARE MAKING NOTES,\nARE YOU?\nWhen you get to a Dream, it might be useful to get a pen and piece of paper.\nMaking notes of the Dreamscape Actions you take, their outcomes might help\nkeep track of things happening and might help you with more intricate puzzles.\nRUNNING OUT OF TIME\nWhenever you feel you do not have enough Turns to finish a Dream, do\nnot hesitate to use the Clock. It allows you to add more turns to the Dream.\nIt is really helpful, especially if you play solo.\nAnother use for Clock is the ability to move by paying with Hours. It\nis most useful whenever you find yourself within a range of an Entity and\nwithout any cards left in your hand.\nTURNS & ROUNDS\nBe sure that you are playing by the rules. During each turn, you can perform\nany number of actions (as long as you can pay their costs). Rounds are\nused only for structuring the gameplay, and there can be as many rounds\nduring each turn as you want!\nDuring each round, you can perform one Dream action (e.g. Map Action,\nDream Gate tile action, etc.), but you may place any number of Progress\ncards, Shining Gems, etc.\nRemember that Dreamscape Phase starts only when all players decide to\npass their rounds.\nAN ENTITY WITH MULTIPLE MINIS\nRemember that even if you are in the range of multiple tokens/minis of\nthe same Entity, you are affected by it only once!\n/SPOILER ALERT/\nE.g. When you encounter Shapeless, your Dreamer will suffer only one and discard 1 Progress,\neven if you are in range 0 of all three of them.\nIt means that you only check if you are in the range of 0 from any of them, and it does not\nmatter if there are more than one of them.\nThere might be cases (like Dreadful Spiders) when the number of Entities in range matters.\n",

Please also note that from this point on **TILES** will be referencing the **larger square "cards"**.\n\n- Note that you do ***not*** need to use the game board (or neoprene mat if you bought it) but it is useful for the first game to figure out how to lay out the map tiles.\n\n<u>**SECRET CARDS**</u> - ***This is the most important part so pay attention!***\n\n1. Put the 4 card packs labelled "Do not open this deck" at one end of the card tray without opening them.\n2. Unwrap the remaining card packs but ***keep them in order***! The vast majority of these are **SECRET CARDS** and can be identified by the card IDs in the top right corner on their backs. The card IDs start with a Roman Numeral (either I or II) followed by a number (I-42) and sometimes a letter.\n\n    ![Card ID](/assets/images/secrets/sort.png "Card ID")\n\n3. Organise these in order and place them either in the main long well of the core box **or** the thinner well of the box the sleeves came in (if you bought them). For example these cards will be arranged like this:\n\n**I-01 A, I-01 B, I-01 C, ... I-02 A, I-02 B(x4), .... II-23 A and so on.**\n\nYou may want to place a generic divider (it doesn\'t matter which one for now as you can change it later) in between where the Roman Numerals change from I to II (to help you find cards more easily). These are mostly in the correct sequence to start with but even if your cat knocked them all over the ground you should still be able to arrange them in order (albeit it will be a special kind of torture). \n\nDon\'t panic if some cards *seem* to be missing - this is deliberate. If you are afraid you are missing cards, a card list can be found <a href="https://www.etherfields-secrets.com/forum/official-faq/list-of-all-secret-cards-and-tiles">here</a>.\n\n**The rest of the starting cards below do not have IDs on their card backs.**\n\n<u>**DREAMER INFLUENCE DECKS (22 for each Dreamer)**</u>\n\n![Dreamer Ability](/assets/images/secrets/dreamer-ability.jpg "Dreamer Ability")\n\n![Player Aid](/assets/images/secrets/player-aid.jpg "Player Aid")\n\nThere are 4 (or 5 if you bought the 5th player character expansion) Dreamer Influence Decks - Free Spirit, Gambler, Specialist, Tough Guy,\nReaper (the expansion character). Sort these by their characters and place a **Basic Action Card** with each deck. You can use the corresponding dividers to store these in the main core box or in the decorative card boxes if you bought them.\n\n<u>**STARTING ITEM CARDS (5)**</u>\n\n![Item Card](/assets/images/secrets/item-card.jpg "Item Card")\n\nTake these item cards and set them aside. You don\'t have access to these yet but they\'ll be used later.\n\n<u>**STARTING FATE (10) & FLAW (6) CARDS**</u>\n\n![Fate Card](/assets/images/secrets/fate-card.jpg "Fate Card")\n\n![Flaw Card](/assets/images/secrets/flaw-card.jpg "Flaw Card")\n\n**Shuffle these decks separately** and place them on the allocated board spaces or off to the side. These will not be used till much later.\n\n<u>**INFLUENCE CARDS (81)**</u>\n\n![Influence Card](/assets/images/secrets/influence-card.jpg "Influence Card")\n\nThese make up the **Starting Influence Market** - shuffle these and set them aside. These will not be used till much later. If you own the 5th player expansion (Reaper) there will be a few additional Influence Cards - put these in with the Influence Market even if you are not using the Reaper.\n\n<u>**TURN CARDS (12)**</u>\n\n![Turn Card](/assets/images/secrets/turn-card.jpg "Turn Card")\n\nThese are used right away - shuffle them and place them in their allocated board space **faceup**. Note that throughout the game you will only see the top faceup **TURN CARD** also known as the **current turn order card** but will not be able to look through the entire deck. Alternatively, you may choose to do so if you prefer a more strategic variant. In the First Dream it doesn\'t matter too much and you can choose based on your preferences later.\n\n<u>**SQUARE TILES**</u>\n\n![Tile Cards](/assets/images/secrets/tile-card.jpg "Tile Cards")\n\nAll the **larger square cards** are known throughout the game as ***TILES***. Unwrap them now and, as with the secret cards, ***keep them in order***! As before, these are organised in order of the card IDs on their backs. You can place these either in the larger well in your core box or, if sleeved, in the box the sleeves came in.\n\n<u>**OTHER COMPONENTS**</u>\n\nYou can either choose to unpunch the other cardboard components as you need them or unpunch everything, keeping them organised (eg. with zip bags) - you can use **pg 3 of the rulebook** as a guide. Be careful not to discard the blank cardboard tokens as these will be used much later.\n\nWhen you are organised you can start the game by choosing your Dreamers.\n\nContinue by clicking on the **DREAMERS** button.\n',

In dreams, we don\'t have a problem with that - but here in this "real" stable world we share with others there are so many barriers to achieving this.*\n\n*The Final Frontier - a great challenge, a scientific project that eventually destroyed the world. The results of the study were bleak at first. We were searching for the difference between the world of dreams and what we called reality, and slowly understood that there was no difference. A study by our scientists suggested that the Dream world was less real. What was more surprising was that when the exact research methodology was replicated by scientists on the other side the conclusion was exactly the opposite - that our waking world was "less real".*\n\n*It looked like we were our own mirror images. The only differences being that our world was more stable and the Dream world possessed greater powers of creation. We were able to move between these two worlds without any problem. However this was not enough for us. We desired to control completely this power of creation. Because it was shared with billions of other dreamers everything here was the average of all that we believed in, what we wanted and what we were afraid of.*\n\n*And then, the ESC developed the first prototype of the Key. The principle was that if you could isolate your part of the dreamworld, you could change it to a limited extent and forcibly bring your dreams into reality. We strengthened our frequencies surpressing those belonging to others and after suffering a miserable beginning, the door was finally opened. The rest was merely a technology race.*\n\n*Coupled Keys, reinforced Keys, accelerated Keys, i-Keys. Technology quickly became obsession. Everyone wanted to maximise their own individual control over creation and Dreams. This technology was not cheap so ordinary people could not afford even the cheapest and weakest of Keys, becoming slaves of worlds created by others.*\n\n*Reality was greeted with new wonders - bigger with every passing day, grander and more amazing than ever before. It became full of realised dreams. Unfortunately it also resembled the dreamworld more and more. Individual new worlds became so separate that, in the end, nothing distinguished them from ordinary dreams. There was no longer one shared reality - it had fractured into nothing more than countless, infinite microcosms.*\n\n*So my belief when it comes to the Great Disaster was that no one really attacked us. It wasn\'t a meteorite, or sun flares, nor from any divine judgement. This force was too powerful and we weren\'t ready to control it. It was no one but outselves, in all of our folly and hubris, who destroyed our own world.*',

  1106: "***Synthetic archives GAP3077/03: Endless Sleep Clinic.***\n\n*When there is a demand for something, the answer appears. In the second half of life, many of us finally realize that there is less time than we would like to have when we begin to see the finish line in sight. Time erodes away our former skills and abilities, our former appearance and we all become a shadow of what we were. The reality hits us that it will never be better again. But can we buy some extra time? Can we find our former selves again?*\n\n*Of course, we can - the solution is so very obvious! Thanks to Endless Sleep Clinic (ESC) we can achieve what is impossible. Never again will we have to feel the inevitable decay of our mortal shells.*\n\n*When Professor Shelley started the ESC, he was in a wheelchair, and his eyesight was modest but he definitely knew what he was looking for. He also knew that seconds of genuine brightness, moments of happiness, and revelations of truth appear very rarely in ordinary life being difficult to see in the rat race of the waking world. In dreams however, we experience them all the time.*\n\n*He noticed that memories of real events and dreams were perceived in the same way by the human mind. Time however moves much slower in dreams, and in a few seconds, you can experience long hours, and in hours - whole weeks. Sleeping is one-third of our human lives, simply wasted because we cannot use these hours properly. In dreams, time and opportunity can be found - we can be ourselves again - or even more - there.*\n\n*Such were the early beginnings of the ESC - research, expanding lucid dreaming skills, practicing dream remembering, discovering secrets of strange worlds. And the respondents had more interesting lives there than in their last decades. They visited new worlds, built unforgettable memories, developed new skills, without past pain, without restrictions. Time did not seem to matter. They had never lived like this before.*\n\n*And yet there was one more limit to cross, the final frontier: how could we share our dreams with others?*",

  133.1: '<u>***What do you do now?***</u> Your Dreamers have to investigate the Dreamworld to find out their identities and their purpose here. Remember those **DREAM GATE TILES** that you took out of the secrets before? Those are the **gates** to **"DREAMS"** (just like the tutorial Dream we just finished) that you can enter and investigate. Think of them like missions or levels of a game.\n\nYou have **two** avenues of investigation to start with:- \n\n- a) Find someone who knows what\'s going on (**"Not Alone in the Dark"**)\n- b) Look inwards and see if you can dig up more pieces of your memory (**"I\'ll Never Forget those Sunshine Days**)\n\nAs our Dreamers commence their exploration on the Awakening space, conveniently located in **Suburbia**, it is recommended that you start with **Not Alone in the Dark** (but of course you can try the other one first if you like).\n\n![Not Alone](/assets/images/secrets/notalone.jpg "Not Alone in the Dark Dream Gate")\n\nTake a look at the **Dream Gate tile** for this Dream. Alongside presenting the *setup information* and a few hints about the Dream, the Dream Gate Tile also tells you about how to **enter it** and what its **requirements** are. In this case, to enter this particular Dream we would need to make our way to the **Dream Gate location space** (`dreamworld-dreamgate`) in **Suburbia** and spend **2 keys** to activate the Gate. We don\'t have any keys on us at the moment so *let\'s figure out how to get them*.\n\nYou\'ll notice on the Dreamworld Map that a single location space to the south of the map has a **little key** (`dreamworld-key`) symbol. By moving to this location you immediately obtain **1 key**. There are *other ways* to obtain keys of course (eg. within Dreams, through item cards and influence cards) but for now this is most likely the only way available to you. What this means is that you will need to do a ***loop around Suburbia*** in order to get the **2 keys** you need. This will slowly introduce you to all the other mechanics.\n\nWhen you have these keys, go back to the **Dream Gate location** and **discard them** in order to "**enter the Dream**", following **setup** similar to how we set up the *First Dream*.\n\n<u>**NAVIGATING THE DREAMWORLD**</u>\n\n![Dreamworld](/assets/images/secrets/dreamworld.jpg "Dreamworld Map")\n\nThe **DREAMWORLD** is like a global bird\'s eye map of where your team is currently located. Starting with your team marker on the **AWAKENING** space, you will move it around following the **big arrows** until you reach other locations with map icons. These are one-way paths and you normally cannot go backwards against the direction of the arrow.\n\n![Dreamworld Big Arrow](/assets/images/secrets/map-large-arrow.jpg "Big Arrow")\n\n**Smaller arrows** are shortcuts and usually have a cost listed on the map area. In the case of **Suburbia**, if your team were to travel on these routes, you would need to "**Flip (an active progress card) or Seal 1 Card"**.\n\n![Dreamworld Small Arrow](/assets/images/secrets/map-small-arrow.jpg "Small Arrow")\n\nYou\'ll notice that from the **AWAKENING** space you have potentially 2 pathways to head to - the one to the right will lead you into a location with 2 symbols (**a Fate Card symbol** `dreamworld-fate` and a **Slumber Deck symbol** `dreamworld-slumber`) while the left path will lead you to a location with only 1 symbol (`dreamworld-fate`). You can pick either path and then move your **team marker** to that space. Unlike movement on the **Dreamscape** (where you\'re moving your Dreamer miniatures), movement on the **Dreamworld map** is ***freely*** done (except for **shortcuts**).\n\nRegardless of whichever path you picked, the moment you enter a location with symbols you resolve them from left to right.\n\n- If you want to resolve a **FATE card**[`dreamworld-fate`:](/core/133.2)\n- If you want to resolve a **SLUMBER card**[`dreamworld-slumber`:](/core/133.3)\n- If you want to resolve a **SHOPPING location**[`dreamworld-shopping`:](/core/133.4)\n- If you want to resolve a **SANCTUARY location**[`dreamworld-sanctuary`:](/core/133.5)\n',
  133.2: '<u>**FATE CARDS**</u>`dreamworld-fate`\n\n- `dreamworld-fate` - Draw the top card of the **FATE** deck and resolve it. Some Fate card effects occur right away and give you penalties or bonuses, whilst others cause a new **SLUMBER MAP TILE** to be placed. These latter ones are a bit more complicated so we\'ll cover them here.\n\n![Fate Example](/assets/images/secrets/fate_example.jpg "Fate_example")\n\n- If you look at the Fate card above (**"The Strange Hood"**), you\'ll see that at the very top it tells you to **Draw and place 1 Dreamscape Slumber (map) Tile**. We already placed the **2 Starting Ones** earlier so if you happened to draw this card, you would draw another Dreamscape Tile and position it on the **corresponding Dreamscape board space**. As with placing all map tiles, pay attention to placing it so that the designation (eg. C4) matches the label on the board. If you do this correctly ***you should always be able to access the map tile*** from the 2 starting tiles. \n\n![Dreamscape Setup Example](/assets/images/secrets/dreamscape-setup.jpg "Dreamscape Setup")\n- ***This is an example of a more elaborate Dreamscape map (yours will not look like this just yet!) but shows how to place these tiles.***\n\n\n- You\'ll also notice with this particular Fate card, it mentions that if the Dreamscape Slumber Tile has a **QUIRK** slot (you can see a close-up example below) you\'ll place this card there. From now on the **"Quirk effect"** affects the ***whole*** Dreamscape. **Strange Hood** would cause you to have to resolve **"Each Dreamer Seals 1 Card"** every time there is a **"Special Effect"** on the **TURN CARDs** *(on top of whatever effects the Entity performs as well)*. \n\n![Quirk Example](/assets/images/secrets/quirk-example.jpg "Quirk Example")\n\n- Obviously this is potentially very detrimental to your Dreamers but you can see that the card gives you an option to remove it by performing an **Assault 8**`red` `player-x`/**Contact 4**`green` `player-x` action while you are in the relevant quirk space (marked with a **small circle** - see below). Note in this situation you ***cannot*** apply the normal range (of 1) for **Assault/Contact actions** - you need to actually be on the Quirk space. ***But why bother having the action labelled as Assault/Contact then?!*** Some of your **influence** and **item cards** allow you to more efficiently obtain `green` and `red` for **Assault/Contact** actions so it may be an idea to use them here.\n\n![Quirk Space](/assets/images/secrets/quirk-space.jpg "Quirk Space")\n\n- One more thing - you may not encounter this until later but keep it in the back of your mind! You\'ll also notice on some Dreamscape Slumber map tiles this symbol:\n\n![Gem slot](/assets/images/secrets/gemslot.jpg "Gem Slot")\n\nWhen you\'re on a space with this symbol you can spend **1** `gem` and place it on that symbol to activate the effect associated with it. If you\'re on the same space, you may also choose to take the `gem` but this will deactivate the effect.\n\n- [Go back to](/core/133.1)',
  133.3: '<u>**SLUMBER CARDS**</u>`dreamworld-slumber`\n\n![Slumber](/assets/images/secrets/slumber.jpg "slumber")\n\n`dreamworld-slumber` - Draw the top card of the **SLUMBER** deck and resolve it. Be careful not to confuse this deck with the **SLUMBER DREAMSCAPE TILES** - the **SLUMBER deck** has a *vivid red back* and large word (**SLUMBER**) written on it. The Slumber deck consists of *encounters* that your Dreamers bump into while moving from location to location in the Dreamworld. Some encounters are hostile and force your Dreamers to face Entities on the Slumber Dreamscape map, whilst some are benign and give your Dreamers some breathing room to setup and recover resources.\n\nAt the current moment you have ***no influence cards in your hand*** - the only way to obtain these is to enter a Slumber where you will have a normal **TURN** structure (**Dreamers Phase**, **Dreamscape Phase**) and be able to draw and play cards.\n\nAs your Dreamers are just starting out, you\'ll find that many of the Slumber Cards *will not do anything* but check to see whether you have a certain number of **Active Progress Cards** in play before ***"ending the Slumber"***. The moment you satisfy the criteria on these cards, go to the Secret Script entry on the cards.\n\nThe main **ENTITY** that you will meet in the Slumber Deck is the **WRAITH**. The moment you ***draw this slumber encounter*** [go to](/core/133.6) - You may want to write this entry down somewhere to make it convenient for you to return to it.\n\nLastly, the last Slumber card (**the Green One**) is a special Slumber encounter. This Slumber is called **"The DELTA PHASE"**. When you reveal it, follow the instructions on the card. We won\'t really talk about it except to say that it will be a very pleasant surprise and provides a means for your Dreamers to **recover** without having to **Awaken**. \n\n- [Go back to](/core/133.1)',
  133.4: "<u>**SHOPPING**</u>`dreamworld-shopping`\n\nWhen you visit these locations you may discard **one of the Shopping Cards** that was issued to you at the end of the last Dream in order to obtain either more **influence cards** for your Dreamer's deck or more **Items** to your storage.\n\n**If you choose to obtain influence cards:**\n- Each dreamer draws **3 cards** from the influence deck and can buy as many as they like paying the required `ether` listed on the top right of the card. These cards enter your discard pile (to be used when you reshuffle). If you choose not to buy any cards, gain **1** `gem`.\n\n**If you choose to buy an item from the Item Market** (note that at this point there may be no items in the item market, especially if you discovered all of the ones from the Tutorial Dream):\n- Each dreamer may draw **1 random item** from the Item Market and buy it for **2** `ether`. As above, if you choose not to buy any cards, gain **1** `gem`.\n\nAfterwards the used shopping card is returned to the Secrets. Generally you will receive more on successful completion of Dreams.\n\n- [Go back to](/core/133.1)",
  133.5: "<u>**SANCTUARY LOCATION**</u>`dreamworld-sanctuary`\n\nIf you land on these special locations you can choose **one** of these to do:\n\n- **Reshuffle** your influence deck ***without penalty*** (normally you would need to take **1**`damage` or **Seal 3 cards**)\n\n- Unflip **1 progress card**\n\n- **Unseal 1 chosen card**\n\n- **Restore 1 item**\n\nYou'll find a reminder printed on the **Dreamworld Map Wisdom card**.\n\n- [Go back to](/core/133.1)",
  133.6: '![wraith](/assets/images/secrets/wraith.jpg "wraith")\n\n**The Wraith Behind my Back** is the first hostile **ENTITY** you will encounter in the Dreamworld. The moment you reveal this card you will: \n\n1. Place your Dreamers on the `start` spaces on the **Slumber Dreamscape map**.\n\n2. Construct the **Turn Deck** to the indicated number of turns on the **ENTITY tile** (in this case 4 turn cards), turning the top-most card face up.\n\n3. **Spawn the Wrath** (the card tells you to use the Wraith miniature, if you do not have it you can use the Wraith token or substitute a Creature/Human Shapeshifter miniature instead). The location it spawns on is determined by the TURN card - if you have revealed a **TURN SUIT** (`spades`/`hearts`/`clubs`/`diamonds`) that matches one of the `spawn` spaces, it will spawn in that space. Otherwise, if the relevant turn suit `spawn` space is not present it will spawn on the generic one (`spawn`). \n\nIf you examine the entity tile you can see that there are potentially *3 ways* to ***"End the Slumber"***:-\n\n - ***Chase out the wraith***: When it is **not** on a `night` space your Dreamers can **Assault 6**`red` `player-x` **OR** **6**`yellow` `player-x` (in range 1). Doing this would gain you the **"Loot"** listed on the faceup turn card (the turn you managed to do this). Note that to succeed, you would need to contribute a total of **6** `red` `player-x` **OR** **6** `yellow` `player-x` but **not** in a combination of the two if playing with multiple players. \n\n - ***Run out of Turns***: If you have gone through all 4 Turns and have not been able to chase out the Wraith you will get *caught* (and resolve s.770).\n\n - **Decide to skip the encounter entirely**: You can only do this **BEFORE** you start your **DREAMERS phase** (so you do not draw cards if you decide to skip.) You are also caught and resolve s.770.\n\nRemember that the entity will act in the **"DREAMSCAPE PHASE"** (after all the Dreamers have acted) and follow what is displayed on the **TURN** card. [See **ENTITY TURN**](/core/248) and [**MORPHINGS**](/core/248.1) for a reminder about how this works. \n\nYou\'ll also notice that there is a special action you can do in this encounter - Dreamers can spend 7 `green` to place 1 `light` on their tile. `light` ***cancels*** out the effects of `night`... There are other ways to generate `light` of course and some of the spaces on the map tiles don\'t have `night` on them to begin with...\n\nWhen you end the Slumber, note that your Dreamers ***do not get removed off the Dreamscape Map*** - they stay where they are currently to begin in the same positions in the next Slumber Encounter.\n\n***This little elf tells you to ignore Deliverance for now - it doesn\'t concern you yet!***',

Each Dreamer gains their corresponding **First Memory card** - these provide each Dreamer with a goal that, when completed, reveals a little bit more about their lost memories. Leftover First Memory cards (related to Dreamers who are not actually in play) are placed in the Storage. If the related Dreamers join the game later, they gain their First Memory card from the Storage.\n\nNow, it's time to change the game slightly. Don't forget to resolve ***all*** of the following steps! There are many of them because, in addition to rewarding you, they will add many basic elements to the game.\n\n1. Set aside **Card D** and **TILES S & T** *remaining from the Dream*. Then discard the current Dreamscape (the map tiles on the board currently) and remove from the game all cards and tiles of this Dream (except for those already gained by Dreamers or added to the game decks), as well as the **Dream Gate tile** of this Dream. If there are any **Item Cards** that you *did not find* (***hint: did you check the floorboards?***), add them to the **Item Market** (separate to the Item Deck). There is no space for this on the board so place is off to the side where you will remember. You can place the other removed cards in the larger well inside the core game box.\n\n2. Find the 4 **tiles II-36 A**. Two of them have **\"Starting\"** written on their back side - these are the **2 Setup Slumber Map tiles**, and they are always placed face-up first on the Slumber Map (where the Dreamscape was before). You can do that now. Shuffle the others and make a **Slumber Map deck** from them.\n\n    Note that this **DREAMSCAPE MAP** is separate to the **DREAMWORLD MAP** which we'll be placing later.\n\n    ![Slumber Map](/assets/images/secrets/slumber-map.jpg \"Slumber Map\")\n\n    The easiest way to remember this difference is to think **DREAMSCAPE = LANDSCAPE** which is *smaller* in scale vs **DREAMWORLD = WORLD** which is *larger* in scale.\n\n3. Find **tiles: II-37 A, B, C, and D**. One of them, **II-37 A**, is a little different (it has a green back), set it aside and shuffle the other tiles. Place this green tile at the bottom of the stack after you've done that and place the deck on the allocated spot on the board (or off to the side if not using a board).\n\n    ![Slumber](/assets/images/secrets/slumber.jpg \"Slumber\")\n\n    *Where to start our search?

If you haven't gained these yet, they represent the experience Dreamers can gain as they explore the Dream World. They can be used to buy additional Influence Cards and to pay for certain other effects. To spend these you'll need:\n\n8. Gain the **3 cards II-41 C**. These are **Note cards** so you should keep them in the Storage. These particular 3 cards allow you to make purchases if you're in a **Shopping Location** on the Dreamworld Map. When you go shopping for influence cards, **draw 3 Influence cards** from the **influence market deck** and buy as many of these as you want, paying their `ether` costs. If you choose to buy none, you gain a `gem` instead. Shopping for items is similar - except you only **draw 1 random item** from the **Item Market deck** and the cost to obtain it is **2** `ether`. You *may* have no items available currently depending on whether you found them in the 1st Dream or not. \n\n    ***A little more to go.***\n\n9. Find the **6 cards II-41 I** and make a **Seasons deck** from them. Place it on the Seasons slot - you can find it near the Dreamworld Map board. Seasons will change during the campaign, but for now, find the **Ordinary Days** card and place it face-up on the top of the Seasons deck.\n\n10. Find **card II-41 M**. It's the **Awakening Wisdom card** - place it in the Wisdom cards holder. \n\n11. And now, to begin the campaign, resolve the **Awakening** - just follow the steps on the **Awakening Wisdom card** (except for setting up the Slumber map - you've done that already :) ). **Awakening** is a rest mechanic that can be performed after resolving a location effect on the Dreamworld Map that allows you to restore your Dreamer's stamina, removing their distress and sealed cards at the cost of progress (all their active Progress cards are reset along with losing all keys and `gem`). **Note that at NO point during this do you draw influence cards into your hand.**\n\n12. After you've done that, your team marker should be on the **Awakening Space** on the **B2 Dreamworld Map tile: Suburbia**.

  248.1: '**MORPHINGS** - It is recommended that you write this entry number down **(248.1)** if you require a reference to the Morphing Effects later. Alternatively, the back of the rulebook has a list of what morphing token effects do.\n\n**MORPHINGS** (applied during the step on **TURN ORDER** cards) add a boost to the Entity, making it stronger and more dangerous as long as the token is on the **ENTITY TILE**. When you add 1 or more **MORPHING TOKENS**, draw them randomly and place them face up on the Entity tile. It is recommended you use a *small cup* or *opaque bag* to do this but you could also place them face down and draw randomly.\n\n![Morphinglist](/assets/images/secrets/morphinglist.jpg "Morphinglist")\n\n',
  248: 'Below interactions, there are 3 **Entity effects** that this Entity performs in the Dreamscape Phase: **Morphing**, **Basic**, and **Special**, in addition to its **Movement**.\n\n![Morphing](/assets/images/secrets/morphing.png "Morphing")\n\n![Basic](/assets/images/secrets/basic.png "Basic")\n\n![Special](/assets/images/secrets/special.png "Special")\n\nAs you can see, they correspond to Steps on the **Turn cards**.\n\nWhen Dreamers finish their actions in each **Turn**, the **Dreamscape Phase** takes effect. You do this by resolving the current **Turn card** (the face up card on the top of your Turn deck). Resolve all Steps from the current Turn card in order. Steps may trigger some of the Entity\'s effects. For example, the first Turn may be: **Movement**> **Special effect**> **Morphing effect**, and the second one may be: **Basic effect**> **Basic effect** again> **Movement**. Each Turn is different from the others.\n\nThis Entity has no **Morphing** effects available (as it would make it too powerful for you now otherwise). If a specific Entity doesn\'t have some of the effects, treat them as if they do *nothing* when they should be resolved. **Morphings** are basically ***power ups*** that make Entities a lot meaner and more difficult to deal with. When an effect tells you to "**add 1 (or more) morphings**" you will draw randomly from the Morphing Token pile and place them face up on the Entity. From then on, as long as the Entity has the token, it will apply its effects. See [**ENTITY: MORPHINGS**](/core/248.1) for more information.\n\nThe **Basic effect** is the effect that is triggered the most often. The Basic effect will generally harm nearby Dreamers. In this case, if any Dreamer is in **range 1** (*in the same or in an adjacent space*) when resolving the **Basic effect** of this Entity, this Dreamer suffers **1** `damage`. If you don\'t remember how `damage` works, [consult: **Dying**](/core/450.2). In short - if any Dreamer suffers their **8th** `damage`, they die. And usually this isn\'t pleasant.\n\nThe **Special effect** of this Entity has an even *greater range* of **2**. Remember that range may be counted in any direction **orthogonally** (up, down, left, right), but **not diagonally**. A space connected diagonally is in range **2** - 1 space vertically and 1 horizontally. In this case, the Special effect **Seals 2 cards**. [For a reminder of how sealing works go to ](/core/450.2). \n\nIt\'s a good habit to always look at the **Turn card** and check what the Entity will do when you end your **Dreamers Phase**. If it doesn\'t look good, keep a safe distance or attack to temporarily repel the monster.\n\nSometimes your Dreamers will have other tricks up their sleeves in order to manipulate this card. For example, one of your influence cards (**"Thoughtful Moment"**) allows you to ***"Seal it in order to block any 1 Step on the current Turn card"***. When you do this you can use a `marker` to "block" a certain effect from happening. This can sometimes get you out of tight spots!\n\n![Thoughtful](/assets/images/secrets/thoughtful.jpg "Thoughtful Moment")\n\nYou\'ve opened a door and revealed 2 tiles - and so many things have changed!

Take the card below ("Effort") for example:\n\n![Effort card](/assets/images/secrets/effort-card.jpg "Effort card")\n\nYou can see that the "cost" in this case is that your Dreamer will have to take **1** `damage` in order to gain **3** `red` intent. The small lightning bolt symbol on top of the cost means that it can be played at any time.\n\n- Other cards will have require you to ***Seal*** cards in order to gain their effect. Take the card below ("**Hesitation**") for example:\n\n![Hesitation card](/assets/images/secrets/hesitation-card.jpg "Hesitation card")\n\nThis card allows you to **Seal** it in order to obtain **3** `red`, `yellow` or `green` intent (very useful!). [To read more about Sealing/Reshuffling cards go to](/core/450.2). Sealing cards isn\'t ideal as these cards are out of your deck and will not return unless they are ***unsealed*** - this is much harder to do than ***reshuffling*** when your deck runs out.\n\n- Some Influence cards are special in that they are known as **Progress Cards**. These are more useful abilities that can be put down underneath your Dreamer board in order to give you more flexibility in how you navigate Dreamscapes. These cards usually have a colored "aura" around them. Take for example, **Self-Improving Tools** (one of the ***Tough Guy\'s Unique progress cards***):\n\n![Self improve card](/assets/images/secrets/self-improve-card.jpg "Self improve card")\n\nThis card is placed underneath your Dreamer board for **4** `red` intent (or you could discard it for **1** `red` intent to do something else). Once it\'s in your area it becomes an **"Active Progress Card"** and you may only have ***a maximum of 4*** of these out at any time (including if they\'ve been flipped - or disabled - by some other effect). To use this card once it\'s been placed, you need to spend **3** `green` intent which allows you to place **1** `marker` on it **OR** eventually once you\'ve saved enough `marker` on it you may spend **3** `green` to discard them all for **3** `red` each (allowing you to do a massive wallop to something...). \n\nSome rules reference `green-progress`/`yellow-progress`/`red-progress` - these refer to the number of **ACTIVE (placed) PROGRESS cards** of the corresponding color (flipped disabled cards don\'t count).\n\n- Finally all Dreamers have access to their ***own special abilities*** when they are visible on the card backs of their Influence Deck. For example, the Gambler has:\n\n![Dreamer ability](/assets/images/secrets/dreamer-ability.jpg "Dreamer ability")\n\nAll of the Gambler\'s starting influence cards have this ability on their backs. When this is visible you can spend **1** `yellow` intent in order to discard the card (off the top of your influence deck) and reroll **1** of your rolls. Note that as you start to remove these cards or add other cards to/from the Influence Market to your deck, you may find that you won\'t have access to these abilities quite so often. \n\n[Go back to](/core/450)\n',
  450.2: "### Sealing\n\nSealing means that each affected Dreamer has to move the top card from their Influence deck to a personal **Sealed cards** pile. This is worse than **Discarding**, since cards from your **Discard pile** will eventually go back into your deck more quickly when you **Reshuffle**. However, cards from the Sealed pile do **not** get reshuffled. They don't go back until the game allows you to take them back - to **Unseal** them - and are temporarily unavailable to you for longer. It's not a pleasant effect, but you'll need to learn to manage it, as it's one of the most common effects in this game. Note that if you have ***less than 6 cards*** in your play area (discard, hand and influence deck; sealed cards and active progress cards do not count) - you will **die** (see below). \n\nWe recommend you place your **sealed cards** under your unused *Mask* - which you'll get later.\n\nBoth `damage` and **Sealed cards** define how *tired*, *discouraged*, and *wounded* your Dreamer is as their inner resources are sapped away from them.\n\n### Unsealing\n\nUnsealing works in the opposite way to Sealing. When the game instructs you to **unseal** cards you take them from the top of the **Sealed card** pile and place them into your **DISCARD pile**.\n\n### Reshuffling\n\nEventually you will run out of cards to draw from your **INFLUENCE DECK**. When this happens, draw what you can and then **RESHUFFLE** your **DISCARD** pile to reform your deck. Unfortunately this also ***comes at a cost*** - choose to suffer 1 `damage` or **SEAL 3 CARDS** (after reshuffling) to signify your dreamer's continuing exhaustion.\n\n### Death\n\nIf your dreamer suffers their **8th** `damage` or has ***fewer than 6 cards*** (not including sealed or active progress cards) they will die. [Read the **DEATH entry** on the **DREAM GATE TILE** for the 1st Dream](/core/922) or **II-42 I - Death Wisdom Card** for other Dreams). This is very unlikely to happen in this particular dream but (mis)fortune is a fickle mistress...\n\n[Go back to](/core/450)\n",
  450.3: '### Boosting intent\n\nWhy might you need to roll any dice at all, hmmm? One of the available things that a Dreamer can do is that they can **"BOOST INTENT"**. This is a push-your-luck mechanism in order to get more intent than you spent. It is available only **once** per dreamer every turn* by rolling the **LUCK DIE** when you spend at least **1 INTENT**. This is *optional* but must always be the ***last source*** of adding Intent to an action.\n\n![Luck die](/assets/images/secrets/luck-die.png "Luck die")\n\n**If you roll**:\n\n- `luck-x`: **Fail** to perform the action and *don\'t reclaim discarded influence cards*. Also discard **1** `ether` or suffer **1** `damage` or **SEAL 3 cards**.\n\n- `luck-blank`: No additional intent added. If the action fails, don\'t reclaim discarded influence cards.\n\n- `luck-1`/`luck-2`/`luck-3`: Add **1** / **2** / **3** Intent of the same colour.\n\n[Go back to](/core/450)\n\n*Remember that a **TURN** is one **DREAMERS PHASE** followed by a **DREAMSCAPE PHASE** and is represented by a **TURN CARD**.',
  450.4: "**DREAMSCAPE PHASE/ ENTITY TURN**\n\nRight now there probably isn't an **ENTITY** (think of them like the enemies for now) on the map so you can ignore most of this phase (and everything listed on the current face-up **TURN CARD**) for now, discarding it (**face down**), revealing the next one and just skipping towards starting another **DREAMERS PHASE** by *drawing 4 influence cards again* (up to your 6-card hand limit). Remember that you only draw as many cards as it takes to bring your hand size to 6 cards (eg. so if you had 4 cards in hand, you would only draw 2 more cards) and can discard as many cards as you want ***before*** you draw. \n\n[If you've revealed the Entity of this dream already go to:](/core/248)\n\nOtherwise [Go back to](/core/450)",
  450: "*Through the abyss, we crawl out from the cold dark rift to... we're not quite sure. Where are we? What is our mission? More importantly, who are we? In our gut we know that something went wrong, possibly catastrophically wrong.*\n\n*We thought we still remembered a moment ago but now, just like grains of sand slipping through our fingers, our memories have also disappeared. That feeling of trying to remember an elusive dream upon waking from a deep slumber...*\n\n*We have some equipment with us but we're not sure what it's used for. Everything functions differently here. Things decompose into scrap in an instant and just as easily reform into other things. If we put something down for a moment, sometimes it transforms immediately into something else.*\n\n*We hear song birds. We smell wet earth after the rain. Petrichor \u2013 we recall the curious name of this scent. We remember that we wandered through a maze of forest paths, each too similar to the last. But we're still in the woods and probably have been for a very long time. Dirty, torn clothes, burning muscles, a consuming hunger. Memories of being pursued rise from the depths of our memories - we had barely escaped and the fear gnaws at the edge of our minds. Fog rises from the steaming earth. The golden rays of the setting sun shine behind the trees. Komorebi \u2013 another pleasing word. It's getting cold, though. We must hurry. Finally, we reach a lea in front of a rock wall with massive gates.*\n\n***The imposing gates are locked. There are three locks, each with a symbol identical to that on one of the pedestals next to it \u2013 a leaf, a padlock, a wave. A small tree grows on the first pedestal, a large rusty padlock is attached to the second one, and on the third is a stone ewer from which water flows endlessly. Unconsciously we know that through gate is the way to our escape. Now just to open it...***\n\n**This is the beginning of the tutorial segment.** There may seem like there are a lot of rules up ahead (and there are!) but we'll attempt to walk you slowly through it. Let's practice the basics then.\n\nThis is the start of a Dream and you're looking down at a bird's eye view map of the area around you. Each **MAP TILE** consists of four **spaces**.\n\n![Map Tile](/assets/images/secrets/secret-tile.jpg \"Map Tile\")\n\nPlace your Dreamer miniatures in `start` **(Dreamer's Entrance)** spaces. As the `start` symbol straddles two spaces, you may choose *either of them*. A space can contain at **most 4 figures** - these are combinations of Dreamer miniatures and/or other miniatures.\n\nA **TURN** will consist of a **DREAMERS PHASE** where all Dreamers will draw up to **4 INFLUENCE CARDS** from their **Influence Deck** to their *maximum hand size* which is typically ***6***, followed by a **DREAMSCAPE PHASE** (more on that later). So for example, if you had 3 cards in your hand already at the beginning of the Dreamers Phase you would only draw 3 cards, which brings you to your hand size of 6 cards. Similarly if you had 4 cards, you would only draw 2 cards. ***Before you draw you may discard any number of cards.***\n\nHowever you have *no cards in your hand* at the moment so **DRAW 4 INFLUENCE CARDS NOW.**\n\nNow let's look around the map.\n\nYou see ***3 pedestals*** dotted around the Dreamscape tile you're on and on each one you will practice different actions that make up most of the ***different types of map actions*** that may appear throughout the game. \n\n***Oh but we forgot one thing haven't we?*** **How do you get to these spaces first?** \n\nIf you look at your hand of cards now you'll notice on the top left they will have a bunch of symbols, namely `yellow`, `red`, `green`. These represent your Dreamer's inner resources or **INTENT** to deal with problems: \n\n- `yellow` is your **CUNNING** and is mainly related to movement, avoidance, cleverness and deception.\n- `green` is your **AWARENESS** and is mainly related to diplomacy, conversation, observation, understanding and aptitude with technology.\n- `red` is your **WRATH** and is mainly related to physical actions, fighting, tenacity and argument. \n\n**Movement**\n\nNow to **move** you will need to discard influence cards with `yellow` **intent** on them - one **intent** for each space of movement. So if you wanted to move your Dreamer **3** spaces you could discard one influence card with **2** `yellow` intent and another one with **1** `yellow` intent. These cards go to a **personal discard pile** (you can keep these face up on the right side of your Dreamer Board) and you get to move your Dreamer miniature to the intended space. Remember that ***you cannot normally move diagonally***. If you decide to move *less than* the number of intent you spent - this is possible also, but any excess intent is lost. In fact with **any** of your actions, if you overspend, any excess influence is lost. \n\n***Now back to the MAP ACTIONS...***\n\n![Green action](/assets/images/secrets/green-action.png \"Green action\")\n\n- The **green** one is a simple action with a cost of **6** `green`. To pay for this you will **need to be on this space** and then discard Influence cards from your hand for **Intent** - specifically cards with `green` icons in their top left. So I might discard 2 cards with 2 `green` each (for a total of 4) and 2 more cards with `green` each (for a total of 2) to make up this cost. This all has to be paid in the **one action** by **only one Dreamer**. You may find that you need to keep cards from turn to turn in order to have enough intent to pay for this. Once the cost has been paid, you read the relevant entry in the Secret Script. \n\n![Yellow action](/assets/images/secrets/yellow-action.png \"Yellow action\")\n\n- The **yellow** one is an action for **3** `yellow` ***but*** you have to pay it as many times as the number of Dreamers (that's what `player-x` means) in *gradual increments*. We call these **gradual actions** and they are only resolved once the full cost has been met. As before you also need to be on this space to pay the costs. \n\nSo for example if there are **2** Dreamers playing, the total cost of activating the space is **2** `player` x **3** `yellow` = **6** `yellow` intent. This can be paid all at once in a *single action* **OR** progressively over multiple **TURNS** in increments of 3 `yellow` intent, with each payment tracked by a `yellow-marker` **(Yellow marker)** placed on the space of the action. \n\nTo illustrate this, on one turn, *the Free Spirit* might pay **3** `yellow` intent first to contribute to this (by discarding 3 `yellow` intent worth of cards from her hand). You place a `yellow-marker` on the space to represent this. Then on another turn, *the Tough Guy*, can contribute another 3 `yellow` to complete the action, reading from the relevant script. Alternatively if you just had 6 `yellow` intent you could pay it outright and complete the action.\n\n![Red action](/assets/images/secrets/red-action.png \"Red action\")\n\n- The **red** one is an **Assault action** with a cost of 6 `red` (representing ***wrath*** thematically). This special type of action can be performed at a **range of 1** (the space itself or an adjacent space but *not diagonally*). One action which hasn't been featured on this map is the **Contact action** which is very similar to the **Assault action** but uses `green` intent instead and also has an **action range of 1**. Some of your card abilities will only work with **Assault** or **Contact** actions. Sometimes you might run into actions with \"red\" or \"green\" words but if they do not mention specifically **Assault or Contact** they are not these actions.\n\nAdditionally, the actions on the **yellow and red pedestals** have a `block` icon, which means that they are **one-use only** \u2013 when performed, place a `block` token on them to mark that they are no longer available.\n\n![Gem action](/assets/images/secrets/gem-action.png \"Gem action\")\n\nThere is another action in the lower-left corner of the **A2 tile**. This one allows you to gain **1** `gem` **(shining blue gem)** for **1** `green` intent. The only limit to how many times you may perform it is the number of `gem` available (**6**) \u2013 treat yourself to all the `gem` if you like but this might mean that other Dreamers don't have access to them (if you're playing with others). What are `gem` used for? You may use them to **reroll any die**. Why might you want to roll the di(c)e in the first place? [See](/core/450.3) - **BOOSTING INTENT.**\n\n![Free action](/assets/images/secrets/free-action.png \"Free action\")\n\nIn the lower-right corner, there is a **free action** (with a cost of *zero*) \u2013 you only have to be in this space to use it. There is also a *wall* close-by - this is an impassable barrier that you can't move through or measure range through.\n\n![wall](/assets/images/secrets/wall.png \"Wall\")\n\nYou'll also note that some of your cards have abilities on the bottom of them that can be used to pay for Intent. These abilities typically allow you to obtain Intent more efficiently.
